<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">W<span class="sc">ell</span>&mdash;here we are again! The old
year has passed away, and the
new one has come. How rapidly
the months have flown! It seems
but a brief space since our last farewell
to the old year,&mdash;&#8203;and since we greeted
you all with wishes of a happy new one.
And yet, within that space, this great
world on which we live has made its
annual journey of three hundred millions
of miles around the sun&mdash;&#8203;and we
have kept it company. The year 1843
has departed, and carried up to heaven
its record of good and of evil!</p>

<p>And we are now at the threshold of
another year; we are about to begin a
new race&mdash;&#8203;to perform a new journey.
The year 1844 is an untried region&mdash;&#8203;an
unknown country. What may be there
in store for us, we cannot say. But let
us start with cheerful hearts, with hopeful
anticipations, and with a stock of
good resolutions.</p>

<p>It is the first day of January,&mdash;&#8203;that
cold and stormy month, which the ancients
represented under the image of
an old man, with a long beard,&mdash;&#8203;such as
appears at the head of this article. Boys
and girls&mdash;&#8203;I wish you all a happy new
year! But what are mere wishes?
<span class="pageno">2</span>
They are idle breath&mdash;&#8203;a mockery of
words, unless the heart goes with them.
And my heart, on the present occasion,
does go with my words. I not only wish
you a happy new year, my friends, but,
so far as in me lies, I intend to make it
a happy one for my readers. I have in
store for them&mdash;&#8203;not cake and candy&mdash;&#8203;not
sweetmeats and sugar-plums&mdash;&#8203;but
rhymes and riddles&mdash;&#8203;fables and allegories&mdash;&#8203;prose
and poetry&mdash;&#8203;lays and legends&mdash;&#8203;fact
and fancy&mdash;&#8203;in short, a general
assortment of such things as belong
to a literary museum for young people.
And although I profess to deal in matters
that may amuse my friends, I have
still a desire that, while they are entertained,
they shall be instructed. The
only way to be happy&mdash;&#8203;really and truly
happy&mdash;&#8203;is to be wise; and wisdom
comes through teaching&mdash;&#8203;through education.
I think I can make this very
plain, if you will listen to me a few moments.</p>

<p>You know there are such people as
savages&mdash;&#8203;those who roam wild in the
woods, or dwell in wigwams, sitting
upon the ground, and sleeping upon the
skins of beasts; those who have no
books, nor schools, nor churches; those
who have never read the Bible; those
who know not Jesus Christ, nor the ten
commandments.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;&#8203;what makes the difference between
these wild, savage people, and
those who live in good houses, in towns
and cities, and have all the comforts and
conveniences of life? Knowledge makes
the whole difference, and knowledge
comes by instruction&mdash;&#8203;by education. Do
my little readers know that without education
they would be savages? Yet it
is really so. All are born alike&mdash;&#8203;the
child of the savage, and the child of the
Christian. One grows up a savage, because
its father and mother do not send
it to school&mdash;&#8203;do not furnish it books, do
not teach it to read and to write. The
other grows up a Christian, because it
is instructed&mdash;&#8203;it is educated. Education,
therefore, makes us to differ.</p>

<p>Now, what do you think of this? Do
you observe, that all our little friends,
who hate books, and school, and instruction,
are trying to be like little savages?
Bah! I hope none of my readers are so
unreasonable. I hope they see that it is
best for them to be Christians&mdash;&#8203;and as
far as possible from the savage state. I
think one thing is very clear: our good
Father in heaven, whom we ought all
to love and obey, did not intend us to be
savages; and, at the same time, he has
provided only one way to avoid it&mdash;&#8203;and
that is by education. He makes it our
duty, therefore, as well as our happiness,
to seek instruction&mdash;&#8203;education.</p>

<p>This design of Providence is very apparent,
when we compare man with animals.
Birds and beasts do not go to
school; they are provided with all needful
knowledge by that power which we
call instinct. A little chicken, only a
day old, will run about and pick up
seeds, which lie scattered among the
stones and dirt. How does the chicken
know that seeds are made to eat, and
that stones are not made to eat? How
does the chicken distinguish the wholesome
and nutritious seed, from the dirt
and gravel? God has taught it&mdash;&#8203;God
has given it a wonderful instinct, by
which it is guided in the choice and discovery
of its food.</p>

<p><span class="pageno">3</span>
But the infant has no such instinct;
left to itself, it will pick up dirt, stones,
pins&mdash;&#8203;anything that comes in its way&mdash;&#8203;and
put all into its little greedy mouth!
The child has to be taught everything
by its parents or its nurse. It must be
taught what is good and what is evil&mdash;&#8203;what
to seek, and what to shun.</p>

<p>The chicken runs about, as soon as it
is hatched; the child must be taught
first to creep, then to walk. The chicken,
left to itself, though but a day old,
will hide from the hawk that would devour
it; the child, if left to itself,
would as soon go into the fire, or the
water, or the bear’s mouth, as anywhere
else. The chicken is guided by instinct&mdash;&#8203;the
child by instruction.</p>

<p>Thus it appears, that, while instinct is
the guide of the animal world, education
is the instrument by which children are
to reach their true destiny. God meant
us to be educated; and children who
hate education, hate God’s will and
God’s way; they hate the road that
leads to their own happiness. Think of
that&mdash;&#8203;black-eyes and blue-eyes!&mdash;&#8203;think
that when you resist instruction, you
resist the will of Providence, and sin
against your own peace! The designs
of Providence, in respect to animals and
mankind, appear very striking from
other considerations. Now a beaver is
a natural architect, and his instinct not
only teaches him the art of house-building,
but he has a set of tools ready furnished.
He has sharp teeth, with which
he cuts down trees, and divides them into
proper lengths: thus his teeth answer
both as hatchet and saw. His tail is
flat, and when he has laid on his mortar,
he turns round and spats it with his tail,
which operates like a mason’s trowel.
So here is a carpenter and mason, both
in one, educated by nature and provided
with a set of tools, scot free. What a
happy fellow!</p>

<p>So it is with the woodpecker; he
never learnt a trade, or paid a shilling
for tools&mdash;&#8203;yet he knows how to chisel
out his hole in a dry tree&mdash;&#8203;and his bill
answers as both gouge and hammer.
The spider has no shuttle or loom; he
never had a lesson in the factories of
Lowell&mdash;&#8203;yet he weaves his ingenious
web&mdash;&#8203;and he sets it, too, so as to take
his prey.</p>

<p>Surely, Providence has taken care of
these creatures in a wonderful way.
And perhaps you think that God has
been more kind to them than to human
beings; for while He teaches the animal
world, He leaves children to schoolmasters;
and while He teaches the beavers
and the birds their trade, and furnishes
their tools, gratis&mdash;&#8203;boys and girls must
serve seven years for a trade, and pay
for their tools when they have done!</p>

<p>But let us look a little farther. It is
true that if children refuse to learn&mdash;&#8203;refuse
to be educated&mdash;&#8203;they remain ignorant,
and like savages. But children
can learn, if they will. Education is
offered to them&mdash;&#8203;and, if it is improved,
what is the result? Look around, and
see what mankind, who have obeyed the
will of God, and who have improved
their faculties by education,&mdash;&#8203;see what
they are, and what they have done.
The instinct of the beaver is very wonderful&mdash;&#8203;but,
after all, it only enables the
beaver to build rude mounds of earth,
wood and stone, which serve as its
abode; and also enables it to provide its
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pageno">4</span>
simple food of roots and grass and fruits.
This is the whole stretch of instinct.</p>

<p>But let us look at the results of education,
operating upon the faculties of
man. Look at Boston&mdash;&#8203;what a mighty
city! How many houses&mdash;&#8203;and if we go
into them, how beautiful&mdash;&#8203;how convenient!
Look at the paved streets&mdash;&#8203;the
pleasant side-walks! Go into the shops,
and see the beautiful merchandises. Go
into the Museum, in Tremont street, and
see the wonders there, gathered from the
four quarters of the globe. Go down to
the waters and see the ships, made to
plough the mighty ocean, and hold intercourse
with the ends of the earth.
Go to the Atheneum, and see the stores
of knowledge, which man has discovered.
Go to the churches, and see the
people holding communion with that
God who built the earth, and spread out
the heavens. Open the Bible, and read
the wonders of revelation&mdash;&#8203;the immortality
of the soul&mdash;&#8203;the mighty plan of
man’s salvation. Go to the fireside, and
see the comfort&mdash;&#8203;the peace&mdash;&#8203;the happiness,
which are there. And remember
that all these things&mdash;&#8203;every one of them&mdash;&#8203;is
the product of education. Oh, who
then would be content with instinct,
merely because it is easy, and costs nothing;
and spurn education, because it
requires effort?</p>

<p>Education, then, is a great and glorious
thing; but remember that you must
take advantage of it. The old adage
says&mdash;&#8203;“One man may lead a horse to
water, but ten can’t make him drink.”
It is so with children in education: it is
easy to send them to school&mdash;&#8203;easy to
put books before them&mdash;&#8203;easy to give
them good counsel; but if they will not
try to learn, they will not learn. You
cannot teach an unwilling mind. When
I was a boy, I caught a blue jay, and
put him in a cage; but the fellow
wouldn’t eat. I got hold of his head,
and opened his mouth, and put some
cherries down, but he wouldn’t swallow;
and as soon as I let him go, he
threw it all up; and so he died! Now,
this is just the way with some boys and
girls&mdash;&#8203;they will not take knowledge into
their minds; they reject good counsel;
even if you cram it down, they throw it up.
Isn’t that bad? Yes&mdash;&#8203;very bad indeed.</p>

<p>Now&mdash;&#8203;ladies and gentlemen&mdash;&#8203;boys
and girls&mdash;&#8203;walk up,&mdash;&#8203;here’s Merry’s
Museum for 1844! We are going to
set matters all right; we are going to
show the advantages of education, the
pleasures of education, the duty of education.
We shall have our sweetmeats
and sugar-plums, as we go along; but
still&mdash;&#8203;still&mdash;&#8203;we mean to know a great
deal more at the end of the year, than
we do now! We mean to lay up a good
stock of knowledge, which may last us
through life. Who will go with us?</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Thorn.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">here</span> was once a boy, named James,
who, with his little brother and sister,
was going to take a walk in the
fields and woods. It was a beautiful
warm day, and James thought he
would take off his stockings and shoes,
and go barefoot.</p>

<p>I suppose my young friends all know
how pleasant it is to take off the covering
of the feet, in a warm summer day,
and run about on the smooth grass.
How light one feels&mdash;&#8203;how swift one can
run with his foot free as that of the
mountain deer!</p>

<p>Now it happened that James had been
forbidden by his mother to take off his
stockings and shoes, for she was afraid
that he would take cold. But he was
now at a distance from home, and he
thought he would do as he liked. So
he took off his stockings and shoes.</p>

<p>Oh, how he did scamper about for a
time; but, by and by, as he was skipping
along, he stepped upon a thorn,
which entered the bottom of his foot, and
inflicted a severe wound. As it gave
him great pain, he sat down and tried to
pull out the thorn; but, alas! it had entered
quite deep, and had then broken
off in such a manner, that he could not
get hold of it. There he sat for some
time, not knowing what to do&mdash;&#8203;but at
last he was obliged to hobble home as
well as he could.</p>

<p>James told his mother what had happened,
for how could he help it? “Ah&mdash;&#8203;ah&mdash;&#8203;my son!”
<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pageno">6</span>
said she, “this comes
of your disobedience. When will children
learn that parents know what is
best for them?” However, the good
woman set to work to try to get out the
naughty thorn, but she could not succeed.</p>

<p>By this time James was in great pain;
so his mother put on a poultice, hoping
that would cure it. But the poor fellow
didn’t sleep any all night, he was in
such distress, and in the morning his
foot was sadly swollen. The doctor
was then sent for, and at last he succeeded
in getting out the thorn; but poor
James had a sad time of it. It was at
least three weeks before he got quite
well. But the event was a good lesson
to him. Whenever, in after life, he was
tempted to disobey his mother, he said
to himself&mdash;&#8203;“Mother knows best&mdash;&#8203;remember
the thorn!” Whenever he was
tempted to seize upon any forbidden
pleasure, he would always say&mdash;&#8203;“Remember
the thorn!”</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Old Man in the Corner; or, the Pedler’s Pack.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">N<span class="sc">ot</span> long since, an old man&mdash;&#8203;a very
old man&mdash;&#8203;came into the office of
Merry’s Museum, and sat down in
a corner of the room. He looked a
little like old Peter Parley&mdash;&#8203;but it can’t
be that it was he, for some say Peter is
dead&mdash;&#8203;and, at any rate, he is not to be
seen about these days.</p>

<p><span class="pageno">7</span>After the old man had sat for some
time,&mdash;&#8203;saying nothing to anybody, and
only looking about with a kind of mournful
countenance,&mdash;&#8203;he got up, and slowly
marched away. When he was gone, one
of the boys found a little parcel on the
bench where the old man sat, addressed
to “Mr. Robert Merry; care of Bradbury
&amp; Soden, 10 School street, Boston.”</p>

<p>On opening the paper, we found an
old greasy book within, written full of
tales, fables, sketches, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; some of
them very good indeed, and some very
queer. The title of the little book was
the “Pedler’s Pack,” and it had the following
motto:</p>

<p>There was no note or direction, which
informed us clearly what the <cite>Old Man
in the Corner</cite> intended we should do
with his book; but we suppose that he
intended we should publish it in Merry’s
Museum. This we have accordingly
concluded to do. We shall insert such
articles as seem suitable for our columns&mdash;&#8203;making
occasional notes of an explanatory
nature. The first article we shall
insert, is entitled <cite>The Blues</cite>; and in
order that our readers may understand
it, we must premise that when people are
sad, or unhappy, on account of troublesome
thoughts, they are said to have the
<em>blues</em>, or the <em>blue devils</em>. The same thing
is meant by the terms, <em>bad spirits</em>, the
<em>vapors</em>, <em>low spirits</em>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> The <cite>Old Man
in the Corner</cite> seems to think that these
troubles may be avoided by a proper
course of life.</p>

<p>Here is his queer article about</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Blues.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">H<span class="sc">ow</span> it rains! Patter, patter, patter!
Well, let it pour! I love the rumble
of the drops upon the roof, like
the prolonged roll of a distant drum.
Let it rain; I am secure. I shall not go
out to-day, nor shall any one intrude
upon my privacy. This day is mine!</p>

<p>A wet day is often considered a lost
day. To me it is otherwise. I can shut
the door upon the world&mdash;&#8203;turn the key
upon life’s cares, and give myself up freely
to the reins of a vagrant fancy, without
reproach of conscience. Providence has
stepped in, and, arresting my tasks and
my duties, gives me a sort of Sabbath
of leisure and mental recreation. To
me a wet day brings no blues, or, if it
does, they are those which come on the
wings of reverie, and are such as I am
sometimes willing to entertain. Your
reasonable blue is a communicative, suggestive
thing, and I always court its society.</p>

<p>And, after all&mdash;what are “the Blues?”
Everything else has been classified, analyzed,
and reduced to scientific system;
and why not these beings which figure
so largely in the history of the human
mind? This is a subject of profound
inquiry, and I wonder it has not attracted
<span class="pageno">8</span>
the attention of the philosophical.
Let us look at it.</p>

<p>To get firm hold of the subject, we
must suppose a case. I sit in my room
alone. Alone, did I say? As nature
abhors a vacuum, the mind instinctively
shrinks from solitude. If fleshy forms
are not present, a host of imps press in
from crack and crevice, to gambol around
us. The mind is like the room in which
the body is held, and these shadowy elves
issue forth from the plastering of the
walls, or peep out from the dark arras
that hangs betwixt the visible and invisible
world. Could we break through
the plastering, or lift the arras, and see
what these seeming imps are&mdash;&#8203;whether
they are things, or only images of things;
whether they are substantial spirits,
which, like invisible eels in water, are
ever playing their pranks behind the
curtain of vision; could we do this, our
task would easily be done; and for our
discovery we should expect to be made
a member of some philosophical society.
But, alas! there is no bridge that crosses
the gulf between life and death&mdash;&#8203;none,
at least, upon which a being of
flesh and blood can return. It is therefore
impossible to follow “the blues”
to their retreats&mdash;&#8203;to the recesses from
which, unbidden, they come, and to
which, pursued, they fly.</p>

<p>What, then, are “the Blues?” In
natural history, there is nothing like
dissection. But, before dissection, we
must have a subject. How, then, shall
we catch a blue?&mdash;&#8203;that is the first question.
The easiest way is to take one by
supposition, and, while we are supposing,
we may as well include the whole
race. These can be arranged as follows:</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Order I. The Blues.</span></p>

<p>These have no head, no heart, no
ears, no breathing organs; body, invisible;
food, the human heart.</p>

<p>We might now proceed to give the
several kinds into which each class is
divided, and then the numerous species
of each kind. But this must be reserved
for some future work on the subject; and
if we should publish such an one, let no
person laugh at our labors, nor sneer at
our philosophy. “The Blues” constitute
a great subject of scientific research,
and are by no means unworthy of the
moral philosopher. We have only time
to make a few observations, to show the
force of this latter remark.</p>

<p>In the first place, it may be noted that
those persons who live temperately, rise
early, and go to bed early; those who
fulfil their duties toward God and man;
those who have good digestion, and a
good conscience&mdash;&#8203;are never visited by
any other blues than Order I., Class I.
If any others ever do come to such persons,
they usually depart as speedily as
a rattlesnake from an ash stick. Of
course, these people are not supposed to
be particularly interested in our subject.</p>

<p>But that numerous class, who are in
the habit of neglecting some daily duty,
or violating some moral or physical law;
<span class="pageno">9</span>
those who eat too much; those who take
strong drinks; those who follow pleasure
rather than peace; those, in short,
who keep the mind like an ill-swept
garret, decorated with dust, cobwebs and
confusion&mdash;&#8203;those persons are doubtless
particularly interested in our subject.
For these, the little blues of the pestiferous
classes have a strong affinity.
Around the hearts of these persons they
are ever to be found. Upon their lifeblood
these elves live.</p>

<p>Of all classes of blues, the Rum Blue
is, perhaps, the worst. Whether the insect
called “<cite>blue bottle</cite>” took its name
from it, or not, is a question for the
learned. The class is pretty numerous,
and includes a variety of genera, among
which are the following.</p>

<table summary="">
<tr><td class="center" rowspan="6"><span class="title">Class II. Rum Blues; <br />or, The Horrors.</span></td>
    <td class="lefthang"><span class="sc">Genus 1.</span> The gin blue.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="lefthang"><span class="sc">Genus 2.</span> The whiskey blue. (In London called “blue ruin.”)</td></tr>

</table>

<p>This class of blues is particularly pestiferous.
There is no great difference
between them, and none but a nice observer
can distinguish them: they are,
however, a most destructive race. They
often assemble in crowds around the
mind, and are then called “<cite>low spirits</cite>,”
or “the horrors,” terms which are descriptive
of their character. They not
unfrequently sting the soul and body
with such agony, as to bring on what is
called the <cite>delirium tremens</cite>&mdash;&#8203;the most
frightful of mortal maladies. Under the
agony of the rum blue, a man will sometimes
murder his wife and children.
This subject is almost too frightful to
dwell upon; but there is one source of
consolation, and that is, that no one ever
need be afflicted with the rum blue. If
a person will only abstain from alcoholic
liquors, he will never be infested
with any species of this kind of vermin.</p>

<p>The class of blues belonging to bad
conscience, as well as that of indigestion,
is numerous, and includes a variety of
genera. We will not now enter into a
detail of them, as our present observations
are intended to be rather practical
than scientific. We may therefore close
this article with the observation, that
<em>whoever is afflicted with the blues, has it
in his own power to get rid of them</em>.</p>

<p>And now, gentle reader, the moral of
all this is as follows. Many people are
subject to pain of mind&mdash;&#8203;which they express
by the terms, <em>blue devils</em>, <em>the horrors</em>,
<em>low spirits</em>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Now, this
pain of mind almost always proceeds
from some misconduct; from the neglect
of duty; from improper eating or
drinking; from wrong doing of some
kind or other. Therefore, if you would
avoid pain of mind&mdash;&#8203;if you would keep
away the blues&mdash;&#8203;adopt good habits, and
stick to them.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">“Don’t give up the Ship.”</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">D<span class="sc">uring</span> the last war with England, a
bloody battle was fought between
the British vessel of war Shannon
and the American vessel Chesapeake.
This took place in the waters
off Boston harbor.</p>

<p>In a short time, the Chesapeake was
terribly cut to pieces, and many of the
men were killed and wounded. The
commander, Captain Lawrence, was
himself mortally wounded, but, while
he was dying, he exclaimed, “<cite>Don’t
give up the ship!</cite>” These striking
words have passed into a proverb, and
nothing is more common than to hear
people say, when they wish to inspire
those who are in difficulty with a new
stock of courage and energy, “don’t give
up the ship!” Now such little sentences,
take the whole world together, produce
an immense deal of effect,&mdash;&#8203;for
very often a person about to despair has
<span class="pageno">11</span>
taken new courage from saying to himself,&mdash;&#8203;or
having it said to him,&mdash;&#8203;“don’t
give up the ship!” I am going to tell
you a story which may show an instance
of this.</p>

<p>Richard Dribble,&mdash;&#8203;familiarly called
Dick Dribble,&mdash;&#8203;was a poor boy, about
eleven years old, who was put out to a
farmer, to go to school, and do chores
at odd hours. I need not describe his
appearance particularly, for his portrait
is at the head of this article; but I must
tell you that Dick was rather disposed
to be lazy and idle. He was a good-natured
fellow, but he hated exertion,
and was even too indolent to keep himself
tidy. He therefore had always a
kind of neglected, shabby and shiftless
look.</p>

<p>Well, it was winter, and one day Dick
was sent of an errand. The distance
he had to go was two or three miles, and
his way led through some deep woods.
Dick had a great coat, but he was too
lazy to put it on, and, though the weather
was bitter cold, he set off without it.
He had not gone far before he began to
shiver like a pot of jelly, but still he
kept on. After a while it began to snow,
and pretty soon Dick’s neck and bosom
were almost filled with it, though some
of it melted and went trickling down
his back and breast.</p>

<p>The boy took it very quietly for a
time; instead of beating off the snow, he
let it rest, until at last he was almost
crusted over with it. His fingers now
began to ache, his nose tingled, his toes
grumbled, his teeth chattered, and his
whole frame shivered like an aspen leaf.
At last the poor fellow began to snivel,
and, stopping plump in the path, he
exclaimed “It’s too bad! it’s too bad!”
Saying this, he gathered himself all into
a kind of heap, and stood stock still.</p>

<p>How long he would have remained
here, if he had been left to himself, I
can’t say; it is probable that he would
have remained inactive till he had
become benumbed and unable to move,
and that he had then lain down and
been frozen to death. Indeed, he was
already chilled through, and his limbs
were getting stiff, and almost incapable
of motion, when a gay young fellow
came driving by in a sleigh. As he
passed, he saw Dick, and exclaimed,
“Don’t give up the ship!” He was
driving very swiftly, and was out of
sight in an instant.</p>

<p>Dick had sense enough left to appreciate
the force of the counsel thus
hastily given; it forced him to see, that,
if he did not make an effort, he would
die; at the same time, it put into his
bosom a feeling that he could overcome
the cold and extricate himself from his
trouble. “At any rate,” said he to himself,
“I will try!” No sooner had he
adopted this view of the case, than he
began to march forward. He rubbed and
beat his fingers; he knocked off the snow
from around his neck; in short, he laid
out his whole strength, and before he
had gone half a mile, he was in a fine
glow, and though his fingers and toes
tingled a little from the hot-ache, he was
very comfortable.</p>

<p>So Master Dick trudged on; he performed
his errand, and returned in
safety. Nor was the adventure wholly
without its use to him. He often
thought of the advice of the gay sleigh-driver,
and the effect it had upon him.
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pageno">12</span>
“Don’t give up the ship,” said he, amid
the piercing and trying circumstances
of after life; and often that brief but
pointed counsel enabled him to triumph
over difficulties which, perchance, had
otherwise overbalanced him.</p>

<p>And now, gentle reader, if you find it
hard to get your lesson, hard to perform
your task, hard to do your duty, think
of Dick Dribble in the snow-storm, and
say to yourself, “Don’t give up the
ship,” and go ahead!</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Bill and the Boys.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">I <span class="sc">have</span> been often requested by my
young readers to tell them something
more about Bill Keeler. I have,
therefore, been rumaging over my
memory, to see if I could pick up something
about him, worth relating. Now
Bill was a great story teller, and he
with myself and several other boys, used
often to get together, and amuse one
another by relating such narratives as
we could invent or recollect. Bill was
always foremost on these occasions, and
not only told the best, but the most
stories. It is my purpose to present my
readers with such of these tales as I can
recollect. I shall not try to put them
down in the exact language in which
they were originally spoken,&mdash;&#8203;but I shall
give their substance and point. The
first of these tales, I shall call</p>

<p class="center">THE LOTTERY TICKET.</p>

<p>There was once a poor, but worthy
man, whose name was Trudge. He
was a pedler, and though he dealt only
in pins, needles, thread, combs and such
little articles, he succeeded in getting a
comfortable living. Nay, more&mdash;&#8203;he laid
up a trifle every year, and finally he
had enough to buy him a small house.
He had a wife and two or three children,
and to this humble cottage they speedily
removed.</p>

<p>Trudge thought himself very happy
when he was snugly established at his
new house. He kissed Mrs. Trudge,
and all the little Trudges; danced “hey
<span class="pageno">14</span>
Betty Martin!” and thought himself one
of the luckiest fellows in the world.
And so he was, if he could have been
content; but, alas! he was beset with
certain very troublesome visiters; they
were Ambition, Envy and Idleness. I
must tell you all about it.</p>

<p>As Trudge travelled about the country
selling his wares, he noticed some fine
houses, around which he always saw
nice carriages, gay horses, and well-dressed
people, who seemed to have
nothing to do but to amuse themselves.
This made Trudge feel uneasy, and he
said to himself&mdash;&#8203;“Why wasn’t I rich,
and why can’t I live in a fine house,
and be a gentleman? Here I am&mdash;&#8203;only
a pedler&mdash;&#8203;poor Tom Trudge&mdash;&#8203;and it’s
all trudge, trudge, from morning to
night; winter and summer, fair or foul,
hot or cold, I must trudge, trudge! If
I was rich, and lived in a fine house, I
should be Thomas Trudge, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, and
then I should be as good as anybody.
I should have easy carriages and fat,
slick horses, and Mrs. Trudge would be
a fine lady!”</p>

<p>Thus it was that poor Tom indulged
his fancy, and all the time Envy and
Ambition and Idleness were at work
within, making him very unhappy.
Envy made him feel a sort of hatred
toward people who were richer than
himself. Ambition urged him to make
every effort to be rich; and, at the same
time, Idleness told him that the greatest
comfort in life was to have nothing to
do. Thus it was that Tom, who had
a neat pretty home, and every necessary
comfort and convenience, was really
miserable, because of these uneasy and
uncomfortable thoughts.</p>

<p>Tom at last opened his mind to his
wife, and it seems that she had been
feeling pretty much like himself. “I
don’t see,” said she, “why we ain’t as
good as the best; and I think it mean
of you, Mr. Trudge, not to let me have
as good a gown as Mrs. Million, up
there on the hill. Last Sunday she
came out with a bran-new yaller silk
gown, and there was I, in the next pew,
in my old caliker; and I thought to
myself, ’tan’t right! And then, you
must know, when the minister said any
pleasant and comforting scriptures, he
looked very kind at Mrs. Million and
her new silk gown, and when he said
anything about the wicked, he looked at
me and my caliker. Now, Tom, I say
’tan’t fair.” And here Mrs. Trudge
buried her face in her apron.</p>

<p>Poor Trudge did all he could to comfort
his spouse; but, alas! the peace of
the cottage was gone. Tom and his
wife had cast out Content and let in
Envy, and Envy is a troublesome companion.
He is never happy himself, and
will let nobody else be happy. Envy is
like a chestnut burr&mdash;&#8203;all covered with
prickles&mdash;&#8203;and the closer you clasp it,
the more it torments you. Yet this
was now the inmate of Trudge’s cottage.</p>

<p>Well, time went on, and things grew
worse rather than better. It is true that
Tom and his wife were thrifty people;
they had now got to be pretty well off
in the world, but still they were by no
means as happy as they once were;
envy and ambition still goaded them on;
they yearned to be rich; and, strange to
say, they hated the people who were in
the station they themselves desired.
<span class="pageno">15</span>
They envied and hated Mrs. Million;
yet they wanted very much to be like
Mrs. Million.</p>

<p>And&mdash;&#8203;who would have thought it?&mdash;&#8203;the
time came when they had an opportunity
to gratify their desires. Tom was
one day in New York, whither he had
gone to buy his stock of pins, thread, and
needles&mdash;&#8203;when he chanced to pass by a
lottery office. Here, in the window,
was a picture of a gay, lightly-dressed
lady, pouring out gold and silver from a
long thing, shaped like a horn, but as
big as a corn basket. Plash went the
money upon the ground, as free as water
from the town pump. A bright thought
struck Tom: “it’s of no use to plod,”
said he to himself; “here I’ve got fifty
dollars; if I lay it out in goods, I must
go and peddle them out, and that’s hard
work. Besides, what’s the use of it?
Though I am a little richer by means of
my labors, still, compared with the Millions
and the Goldboys, I shall be poor.
Now, I’ve a good mind to step in and
buy a ticket in the New York State
Lottery, <span class="larger">☞</span> <span class="sc lowercase">HIGHEST PRIZE FIFTY THOUSAND
DOLLARS!</span> <span class="larger">☜</span> Perhaps I shall
draw it.”</p>

<p>While these thoughts passed in his
mind, Tom entered the lottery office, and
in a kind of frenzy, bought a ticket and
paid his fifty dollars for it. He then
rolled it carefully up in his pocket and
set off for home&mdash;&#8203;a distance of some
forty miles. On his arrival here, he
communicated what he had done, to his
wife; and though she secretly approved
of what he had done, she took him to
task for it roundly; for it was dear Mrs.
Trudge’s way to find fault with everything
her husband did. Besides, in the
present case, she wished, if the ticket
should draw a blank, and the money be
thus lost, to have it in her power to say
to her spouse, <span class="larger">☞</span> “<cite>I told you so, Mr.
Trudge!</cite>”&mdash;&#8203;thereby proving her own
sagacity and her husband’s want of
sense. It is a pleasure to some wives,
to prove that they ought to have been
men, and their husbands women, and
Mrs. Thomas Trudge was one of this
amiable species. But, let us not be
misunderstood. Mrs. Trudge wished
only to degrade her husband in her own
house, so as to keep the upper hand of
him. Out of it, she always praised him
to the skies, and she passed&mdash;&#8203;except
with those who knew better&mdash;&#8203;as a most
obedient, devoted, respectful wife.</p>

<p>The lottery was to draw in about two
months. Tom whiled away the time as
well as he could. It is strange that
creatures who have got only a few years
to live, should still, at least half the
time, be wishing to annihilate that very
time which is so short. Yet so it is.
Tom had given up peddling, for he was
determined to be a rich man, and toil no
more; besides, he had spent his money
in the lottery ticket, and he had no cash
to buy pins and needles with. He went
to the tavern, drank gin sling, loafed
with the idle fellows of the town, talked
politics and scandal, and thus killed the
time; but all did not make him content.
Many times did he say to himself, “This
idleness is a great curse; I wish I was at
work; I’d rather peddle than play;”
and yet, all the time, he was hoping and
yearning for the day when he could be
rich, and live without work.</p>

<p>At last the time came when the lottery
was to be drawn, and Tom was
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pageno">16</span>
preparing to set off for New York, to be
present at the important crisis. “Now,
Tom,” said his wife, “mind! If you
draw the highest prize, I want you to
buy me a yaller silk gown, jest like Mrs.
Million’s, only a great deal smarter. And
do you buy me a red satin bonnet, like
Mrs. Goldboy’s, only redder. And then
do you buy me a new fan, with a pikter
of a Wenus on one side, and a Cowpig
on the other. And then if I don’t go to
meetin’, and see who’ll hold their heads
highest, and who’ll get the comfortin’
scripters&mdash;&#8203;I’m not Bridget Trudge!”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said Tom, in reply,
“and suppose I don’t draw the prize?”</p>

<p>“Suppose you don’t draw the prize!”
said the spouse, “why then you have
thrown away your money like a fool,
and remember what I say; if you don’t
draw the prize, remember that I told you
so; and if you do draw the prize, get
the silk gown and the silk bonnet, and
the fan.”</p>

<p>After a little further conversation, Tom
departed on his errand. The result will
be told in another chapter.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="center sc lowercase">INTRODUCTION.</p>

<p class="center"><cite>About the different colors of the human race.</cite></p>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">he</span> globe upon which we dwell is a
small body compared with the sun, or
with Jupiter, or Saturn; yet it contains
many millions of inhabitants.
The exact number can never be ascertained.
The best estimates make the
number between eight and nine hundred
millions. This number is too great for a
young mind to grasp. A better idea
may be formed of it, by supposing the
whole population of the globe to pass by
you, one by one. How long would it
take you to count them, at the rate of
twenty thousand a day? More than one
hundred and twenty years.</p>

<p>These inhabitants are scattered over
every part of the earth, and are to be
found in almost every island of the sea.
They have penetrated into the frozen
regions, where scarcely anything grows
but moss; where fish, bears and reindeer
are their only food; and where
they are obliged to live in cabins under
ground.</p>

<p>Vast as the number of the earth’s
inhabitants is, and widely scattered as
they are, yet they all sprung from one
pair. This the scriptures tell us. About
six thousand years ago, God created
Adam and Eve in Asia, and from them
all mankind have descended.</p>

<p>Do you ask how this can be? Do
you say, that the inhabitants of different
countries and climates differ much?
They do indeed differ. They differ in
respect to laws, and government, and
manners, and dress, and language, and
color. In this last respect, color, they
differ almost more than in anything else.</p>

<p>Well, because they differ thus much,
you think they could not all have
descended from Adam and Eve? If
they did not, then the Bible, so far, cannot
be true. This would be a sad conclusion.</p>

<p>But, is such a conclusion necessary?
Cannot we account for the differences
which exist among different nations,
<span class="pageno">17</span>
upon the supposition that they all did
descend from Adam and Eve?</p>

<p>Take the difference in color, which
exists among different nations. This,
perhaps, is the most difficult to be
accounted for. A great variety of color
may be noticed; but the various colors
may, perhaps, be reduced to three&mdash;&#8203;white,
black and red. All the others
may be supposed to be different shades
of these.</p>

<p>Now, were Adam and Eve white,
black or red? This we cannot ascertain.
The late Dr. Dwight, I believe, supposed
that they were red; but allow that they
were white; by what process could their
descendants have become some brown,
some yellow, others red, and others still
quite black?</p>

<p>Suppose that a white person in the
United States should constantly go
abroad without any covering upon his
head. What would be the consequence
of his exposure to the wind and sun?
He would “tan,” as we say, or grow
dark colored; and the longer he was
exposed the darker he would become.</p>

<p>Exposure, then, to the heat of the sun,
and to changes in the weather, causes a
change of complexion. Suppose this
same person visits the torrid zone. Here,
as the heat of the sun is much greater,
and the winds are more scorching, we
should naturally expect that his complexion
would darken faster, and, in
time, become of a deeper cast.</p>

<p>This is precisely as we find the fact.
All the inhabitants of the torrid zone
incline more or less to a black color.
Under the equator, where the heat is
greater than in any other part of the
world, they are quite black. In other
parts of the world, where the heat is less
intense, as in the temperate climates,
they are generally white, or only brown.
Still farther north, in the frigid zones,
where the air is very dry, and the cold
very severe, the inhabitants are tawny.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that difference of
climate produces a great difference in
the complexion of people. But do not
nations living in the same climate, differ
in color? They do. This is remarkably
exemplified in the Tartars and Chinese.
The latter are fairer than the
former, though they resemble the Tartars
in features; but, then, they are more
polished, and adopt every means to protect
themselves from the weather. On
the other hand, the Tartars, are a roving
people, without any fixed dwellings; and
hence, are continually exposed to the sun
and air.</p>

<p>We might mention many other causes
of a variety of color. Perhaps few
things injure the complexion more than
want of cleanliness. This recalls to my
recollection a set of people, who were
called Yonkers, and who lived a few
miles from the city of Schenectady, in
the state of New York. When I saw
them, some years since, they consisted
of about one hundred souls. Their
ancestor’s name was Johnson. He and
his wife were white persons.</p>

<p>Being poor and shiftless, they removed
into the woods a few miles from Schenectady,
where they erected a miserable
hut, without a floor, and without a chimney.
Some loose straw served them for
a bed; and in dirt and in filth they lived.
They had several children, who followed
their examples. Other huts were erected&mdash;&#8203;they
intermarried, and in smoke, and
<span class="pageno">18</span>
in grease, and in filth, they and their
descendants have lived. In the hottest
season of the year the children are
accustomed to roll in the dirt with the
pigs around the door; and in the winter
season they play with the ashes and
live in the smoke. They seldom, if
ever, wash; and it is doubtful whether a
child’s hair is combed half a dozen times,
till it is grown up. When I visited
them, which was for the purpose of distributing
bibles among them, it was
stated that only five of the whole clan
were able to read.</p>

<p>The consequence of this filthy mode
of living may be easily guessed. They
appeared like a different race of beings.
Their features were greatly changed;
but much more their complexion. In
this latter respect they were nearly as
dark as the North American Indians.
From this story my readers may learn
something of the influence which manner
of living exerts, not only on complexion,
but even upon features.</p>

<p>From the foregoing facts it is easy to
perceive how white people may, in process
of time, become dark-colored, and
even black. Hence, admitting that
Adam and Eve were created white,
their descendants might, through the
influence of climate and other causes,
become red and even black.</p>

<p>But, you say, perhaps they were not
white&mdash;&#8203;perhaps they were red, perhaps
black. Yes, they might have been red,
or they might have been black. Well,
if they were either of these, you ask
how any of their descendants became
white.</p>

<p>This is a nice question. But, perhaps,
something may in truth be said by
way of a satisfactory answer. We have
seen how a white man might become
very dark-colored, and how his descendants
might become, in process of time,
even black, by removing to the torrid
zone, and there continuing to dwell for
several hundred years.</p>

<p>Now, might not the very reverse of
this prove true? Do not the blacks
from Africa grow lighter colored, when
brought to the northern parts of the
United States? Listen to what President
Dwight says on this subject:</p>

<p>“The change of the blacks,” says he,
“whose ancestors were introduced into
New England, is already very great, as
to their shape, features, hair and complexion.
Within the last thirty years, I
have not seen a single person, of African
descent, who was not many shades
whiter than the blacks formerly imported
directly from Guinea.”</p>

<p>Now, it is possible that the black
people in the United States might
become white, in process of time. I do
not say that they ever will, because their
manner of living is far different from that
of the whites. They are not as cleanly;
most of them are much exposed to the
weather. And this is true of the Indians,
or “red men.”</p>

<p>But, you ask, can any instances be
produced of either “red men” or black
men becoming white? I answer, yes,
instances of both. I will give an account
of an instance of each kind; and I can
assure my readers that the account is
true, and they may find it in an enlarged
form, in Dr. Dwight’s travels. And first,
I shall tell them the story of the Indian,
or “red man.”</p>

<p>Or, rather I might say, that my story
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pageno">19</span>
relates to four Indians. They belonged
to the tribe called Brothertown Indians,
who lived at a place called Brothertown,
in the state of New York. It was in
the year 1791, that Mr. Hart, formerly
minister at Stonington, in Connecticut,
saw four Indians, whose skin, in different
parts of their body, was turning white.</p>

<p>One, whose name was Samuel Adams,
had become almost entirely white. This
Indian told Mr. Hart, that his skin had
been gradually changing its color for
fourteen years. He was a very healthy
man; nor was he sensible of any pain
or disease which occasioned the change.
“His skin appeared perfectly smooth
and fresh, and delicately white.” His
hair, also, had become in part gray, like
that of aged white people.</p>

<p>The instance of a black man, who
became white, is also related by Dr.
Dwight, who himself saw the man, and
examined him. His name was Henry
Moss. He was a native of Virginia.
He came to New Haven in the year
1796, where Dr. Dwight saw him. He
was originally black, and woolly headed,
like other negroes; but, at this time, he
was almost entirely white, and of a
“clear, fresh, and delicate complexion.”
His hair, also, was in part changed, and
was exactly that of fair white people;
of a flaxen hue, and perfectly free from
curling.</p>

<p>From these examples my readers may
learn that no one color is essential to the
nature of the body; and that, as white
men have become black, and red and
black men white, all mankind, how different
soever they may now appear, may
have descended from Adam and Eve,
whatever their complexion might have
been.</p>

<p>I might say much more in relation to
the differences which exist among different
nations; and might, perhaps,
explain how they came to differ so
greatly in respect to language, and dress,
and laws, and government, and other
things; but I must not be tedious.</p>

<p>It would be pleasant, no doubt, to my
readers, could they travel in safety
round the world, and visit the different
nations and tribes of men, and mark the
differences which exist, for themselves.
This pleasure some have enjoyed to a
certain extent; and many are the vessels
which yearly sail from the United
States to various parts of the globe.</p>

<p>A few men have visited almost every
country on the globe; but it would take
a long life to become even superficially
acquainted with the different tribes of
men, had one the means which would
be necessary. But it is not essential
to travel much, to become tolerably
acquainted with the people of different
countries. Different men have travelled
the world over, and have given faithful
accounts of the people whom they saw.
It is desirable to know what has been
thus related. Many of my readers, I
suppose, cannot obtain the books which
have been written on this subject. I
shall, therefore, proceed to tell them
something about it.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Light.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">B<span class="sc">efore</span> the creation of light, the world
must have been involved in darkness.
A state of darkness is the
natural condition of the universe
without light. We are very apt to think
of everything as a matter of course, and
we are not apt to reflect that everything
has been made, created&mdash;&#8203;by God.  Now,
let us bear in mind the fact, that darkness
was the original state of the universe;
then let us reflect upon the stupendous,
beautiful and benignant creation
of light.  How wonderful must
have been the first rising of the sun
upon this world of ours, before involved
in the shades of midnight! How wonderful
must have been the first appearance
of the thousand stars in the sky&mdash;&#8203;and
how wonderful that of the pale, but
lovely moon, hung like a bow in the
heavens, or bursting in its full splendor
upon our world below.</p>

<p>And let us consider a moment what a
wonderful element light is. We do not
understand all its properties, but we
know that it proceeds in a straight direction
from its source. Now the sun produces
light, and it comes to us with an
<span class="pageno">21</span>
inconceivable velocity. The distance of
the sun is ninety-five millions of miles
from us&mdash;&#8203;yet the rays of light reach us
in seven minutes and a half; thus showing
that the rays fly at the rate of two
hundred thousand miles in a second!</p>

<p>Let us consider, for one instant, what
a stupendous work it was to make and
sustain the sun, which is every instant
pouring off a flood of light on all sides,
reaching ninety-five millions of miles,
and flowing constantly at the rate of
two hundred thousand miles a second;
and consider, also, that this process has
been in operation for at least six thousand
years! This is indeed enough to
overwhelm us with wonder and admiration;
and yet we are only considering one
source of light&mdash;&#8203;the sun&mdash;&#8203;while every
fixed star in the firmament is another, and
presents the same topic of admiration.</p>

<p>We might now pass from this view of
the subject, to the uses of light&mdash;&#8203;and remark
upon the fact, that by means of it
we see things. Color and form&mdash;&#8203;all
that constitutes the beauty of the world
of vision&mdash;&#8203;is revealed to us by light.
The production of light&mdash;&#8203;its manufacture
and supply&mdash;&#8203;is a stupendous thing&mdash;&#8203;but
yet its conception, its invention,
was still more wonderful. There was a
time when all was darkness. It was
then that God said, “Let there be light,
and there was light!” But he had an
object in producing light. He intended
that his creatures should see by it.
How great, then, were his wisdom and
goodness in designing it&mdash;&#8203;how wonderful
his power in producing it!</p>

<p>I intend, hereafter, to say something
more about the philosophy of light; but
my intention, at present, is to speak only
of some curious particulars in relation to
it. In the first place, let me tell you
that there are some plants which throw
out light. A gentleman observed, in the
shady recesses of some of the rocks of
Derbyshire, England, a brilliant gold and
green light, which appeared to proceed
from a fine net-work of moss, growing
upon the rocks. In the coal mines near
Dresden, in Germany, there are certain
mosses, which are said to be abundant
and luminous. They are described by
a visitor as appearing in “wonderful
beauty,” and he says, “The impression
produced by the spectacle, I can never
forget. The abundance of these plants
was so great, that the roof, and the
walls, and the pillars, were entirely covered
with them. The beautiful light they
cast around, was almost dazzling; it resembled
faint moonshine, so that two
persons, near each other, could readily
distinguish their bodies.”</p>

<p>The phosphorescence of the sea presents
a most remarkable spectacle.
Sometimes the vessel, while ploughing
her way through the billows, appears to
mark out a furrow of fire. Each stroke
of an oar gives rise to sparks of light,
sometimes tranquil and pearly, at others
brilliant and dazzling. These movable
lights, too, are grouped in endless varieties;
their thousand luminous points,
like little stars, appearing to float on the
surface; and their matter forming one
vast sheet of light. At such times, the
bright waves heave, roll, and break in
shining foam; or large sparkling bodies,
resembling the forms of fishes, pursue
each other, disappearing and bursting
forth anew.</p>

<p>Beautiful illuminations of the same
<span class="pageno">22</span>
kind are frequently seen at a great depth
in the clear water, which in the night time
becomes jet black. Often, through this
dark, yet limpid medium, have voyagers
amused themselves, by tracking the
routes of large fishes, such as porpoises
or sharks, gleaming along in lines of
light beneath the abyss, itself invisible
with gloom.</p>

<p>As Captain Tuckey passed in his
voyage towards Prince’s Island, the ship
seemed to be sailing on a sea of milk.
In order to discover the cause of such an
appearance, a bag, having its mouth distended
by a hoop, was kept overboard,
and, by means of it, vast numbers of
small animals were collected. Among
them, were a great many small sea animals,
with innumerable little creatures
attached to them, to which Captain Tuckey
principally attributed the whitish
color of the water.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i008.jpg"

<p class="center caption">Luminous marine animals, magnified.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Thirteen species of cancer were observed,
not above one fourth of an inch
long; eight having the shape of crabs,
and five that of shrimps. Among these,
some luminous creatures were discernible.
When one species was examined
by the microscope, in candle-light, the
luminous property was observed to reside
<span class="pageno">23</span>
in the brain, which, when the animal
was at rest, resembled a most brilliant
amethyst, about the size of a large
pin’s head; and from this there darted,
when the animal moved, flashes of a
brilliant and silvery light.</p>

<p>Of the number of these little creatures,
of some of which a magnified representation
is here annexed, some interesting
statements are furnished by Captain
Scoresby. “During a run of fifty
leagues,” he says, “the sea was constantly
of an olive-green color, remarkably
tinted; but, on the afternoon of the
17th of April, it changed to transparent
blue. This green appearance of the sea
in these latitudes, was occasioned by
myriads of small marine animals. A
calculation of the number of these animals,
in the space of two miles square,
and two hundred and fifty fathoms deep,
gave an amount of 23,888,000,000,000!</p>

<p>“On September 1st, the sea was colored
in veins or patches, of a brown
color, or sometimes with a yellowish
green; and this water, on being examined
by the microscope, appeared
swarming with minute marine animals.
A drop of this water contained twenty-six
thousand five hundred animalculæ.
Hence, reckoning sixty drops to a
drachm, there would be a number in a
gallon of water exceeding by one half
the amount of the whole population of
the globe. It affords an interesting conception
of the minuteness of some tribes
of animals, when we think of more than
twenty-six thousand individuals, living,
obtaining subsistence, and moving perfectly
at their ease, in a single drop of
water!”</p>

<p>A sea is required for a whale to spout
in; but a common tumbler affords abundant
space for a hundred and fifty millions
of these little creatures! The
phosphorescent appearances presented
by them are not, however, without an
important design. It is probable that
God, whose knowledge is unbounded,
foreseeing that man would learn to traverse
the mighty deep, and explore the
most distant regions of the globe, has
given this brightness to the ocean to
lessen his dangers, and to render his
nights less gloomy.</p>

<p>Especially will this seem likely, when
it is remembered that it is seen only in
the night season, and is vivid in proportion
to the darkness. It disappears even
before the feeble light of the moon, and
increases with the agitation of the sea;
so that, during the prevalence of a
storm, it generally diminishes the dense
gloom, which at such times even the
moon and stars cannot penetrate. It
casts such a light on the ship and rigging,
that the sailors may execute their
allotted tasks with certainty, and at all
times it points out to the cautious mariner
the lurking danger of sunken rocks,
shoals and unknown coasts.</p>

<p>It is well known that sea animals,
larger than those minute creatures of
which we have been speaking, have also
the power of emitting light. Pliny tells
us, that some of the old Romans, in his
time, used to sup in darkened apartments
upon the <dfn>pholas</dfn>, a kind of shellfish,
which gave out sparks of light, and
amused the people, while they gratified
their appetites. A traveller in a remote
land, speaks of fishes that played around
the boats, each being encircled by a halo
of light.</p>
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pageno">24</span>

<p>But the land has its luminous animals,
as well as the sea. The glow-worm is
common in Europe: this is a female beetle,
without wings. It emits a light of a
sulphur color, so strong that if placed at
night on a page of small print, it may be
easily read. In Africa there is an insect
that emits light from two globes, like
lamps, upon its horns.</p>

<p>The fire-fly of South America is very
common, and its light is so brilliant as
that several put together will enable a
person to see to write. The fire-fly of
our country, which seems to make the
landscape at night sparkle as with a
thousand gems, is smaller than that of
South America.</p>

<p>In the East Indies, thousands of lantern-flies,
sending forth a beautiful illumination,
are seen dancing at night amid
the banyan trees; and candle-flies, of
which we give a cut at the head of this
article, have a similar power.</p>

<p>These are a few of the facts connected
with the luminous qualities of plants
and animals. We do not fully understand
the uses of these powers, but we
can see that the subject of light is very
extensive, and that the study of it leads
to a great many curious and wonderful
realities.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Herons and Rooks.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap negindent">A<span class="sc">t</span> Dallam Tower, in Westmoreland,
England, there were, some years
ago, two groves adjoining the park,
one of which, for many years, had
been resorted to by a number of herons;
the other was one of the largest
rookeries in the country. The two
tribes lived together for a long time
without any disputes. At length, the
trees occupied by the herons, consisting
of some very fine old oaks, were cut
down in the spring of 1775, and the
young birds had perished by the fall of
the timber. The parent birds immediately
set about preparing new habitations
to breed again; but as the trees in
the neighborhood of their old nests were
only of a late growth, and not high
enough to secure them from the depredations
of the boys, they determined to
effect a settlement in the rookery. The
rooks made an obstinate resistance, but,
after a very violent contest, in the course
of which some on both sides lost their
lives, the herons at last succeeded in
their attempt&mdash;&#8203;built their nests, and
brought up their young.</p>

<p>The next season, the same contests
took place, which terminated, like the
former, by the victory of the herons.
From that time, peace seemed to have
been agreed upon between them; the
rooks relinquished possession of that
part of the grove which the herons occupied;
the herons confined themselves
to those trees they first seized upon,
and the two species lived together in as
much harmony as they did before their
quarrel.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->
<h3 class="h3head">Spectral Illusions.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">he</span> atmosphere has the power of bending
the rays of light, so that we see
the sun before it actually rises above
the horizon, and after it has actually
sunk below it.</p>

<p>This bending of the rays, produces
some curious appearances, and which
were formerly viewed with superstition.
Dr. Vince, an English philosopher, was
once looking through a telescope at a
ship, which was so far off, that he could
only see the upper parts of the masts.
The hulk was entirely hidden by the
bending of the water, but between himself
and the ship, he saw two perfect images
of it in the air. These were of the
same form and color as the real ship;
but one of them was turned upside
down.</p>

<p>When Captain Scoresby was in the
Polar Sea with his ship, he was separated
by the ice from that of his father for
some time, and looked out for her every
day with great anxiety. At length, one
evening, to his utter astonishment, he saw
her suspended in the air, in an inverted
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pageno">26</span>
position, traced on the horizon in the
clearest colors, and with the most distinct
and perfect representation. He
sailed in the direction in which he saw
this visionary phenomenon, and actually
found his father’s vessel by its indication.
He was separated from the ship
by immense masses of icebergs, and at
such a distance that it was impossible to
have seen her in her actual situation, or
to have seen her at all, if her spectrum
had not been thus raised several degrees
above the horizon in the air by this most
extraordinary refraction.</p>

<p>It is by this bending of the rays of
light that the images of people are often
seen at a distance, and sometimes magnified
to a gigantic size. We have
given an account of such an appearance
in the Hartz mountains, in Germany, in
the Museum, <abbr title="Volume one, page">Vol. i. p.</abbr> 79.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Bats.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">B<span class="sc">ats</span> are of various sizes and many
kinds. In this country there are
various species, but none of them
very large. They are generally
innocent creatures, living in dark caverns
and hidden places during the day,
and sallying forth to feast upon insects
by night. The little bats that we see
flying about of a summer evening, are
very amusing creatures in one respect;
if you throw anything up near them,
they will dive at it immediately,&mdash;&#8203;no
doubt supposing it to be something to
eat. A boy may throw up his cap, and
the bat flies at it instantly, as if he
would make a supper of it.</p>
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="pageno">27</span>

<p>But in other parts of the world, especially
in hot countries, some of the bats
are very large. The rousette bat is
found in the great island of Madagascar,
near the southeast shore of Africa. Its
wings are sometimes two feet from tip
to tip. But the most frightful kind of
bat is the vampire, which is found in
Guiana, on the northeast coast of South
America. The length of its body is
about six inches, and the extent of its
outstretched wings two feet.</p>

<p>This creature sucks the blood from
men and cattle, while they are fast
asleep, even sometimes till they die;
and as the manner in which they proceed
is truly wonderful, I shall endeavor
to give a distinct account of it. Knowing
by instinct that the person they intend
to attack is in a sound slumber,
they generally alight near the feet,
and, while the creature continues fanning
with his enormous wings, which
keeps one cool, he bites a piece out of
the tip of the great toe, so very small
indeed, that the head of a pin could
scarcely be received into the wound,
which is consequently not painful, yet,
through this orifice, he sucks a great
quantity of blood. Cattle they generally
bite in the ear, but always in
places where the blood flows spontaneously.</p>

<p>“Some years ago,” says Mr. Waterton,
in his Wanderings in South America,
“I went to the river Panmaron with
a Scotch gentleman, by the name of
Turbet. We hung our hammocks in
the thatched loft of a planter’s house.
Next morning, I heard this gentleman
muttering in his hammock, and now and
then letting fall an exclamation or two.

‘What is the matter, sir?’ said I; ‘is
there anything amiss?’ ‘What’s the
matter?’ said he, surlily, ‘why, the
vampires have been sucking me to
death.’ As soon as there was light
enough, I went to his hammock, and
saw it much stained with blood. ‘There,’
said he, thrusting his foot out of the
hammock, ‘see how these imps have
been drawing my life’s blood.’</p>

<p>“On examining his foot, I found that
the vampire had tapped his great toe.
There was a wound somewhat less than
that made by a leech. The blood was
still oozing from it. I conjectured that
he might have lost from ten to twelve
ounces of blood. While examining it, I
think I put him into a worse humor, by
remarking that an European surgeon
would not have been so generous as to
have bled him without making a charge.
He looked up in my face, but did not
say a word. I saw he was of the opinion
that I had better have spared this
ill-timed piece of levity.”</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Kin Shan; or, the Golden Isle.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">here</span> is no country more full of wonders
than China, yet we know comparatively
little of it. We know, indeed,
something about Canton, near
which foreign merchants are permitted to
reside; about Nankin, which is famous
for its beautiful pagoda; and about Pekin,
which is a city almost as populous as
London, and where the emperor resides.
We know, also, that there are many other
large cities in China; we know that the
empire is the most populous in the
world, containing three hundred and
forty millions of people.</p>

<p>We know, too, that the Chinese produce
tea, and silks, and porcelain, and
many other curious manufactures; that
they worship idols, and sometimes eat
worms, birds’ nests, rats and puppies;
but still, it has been the system of the
government to exclude foreigners from
the country, and accordingly few travellers
have penetrated into its interior, and
given us an account of what is there to
be seen. It is probable that we shall
soon know more about China, for the
British have sent soldiers and ships out
there, who have made the emperor
agree to be more sociable, and let foreigners
come into his domains a little
more. Our government has sent out
Mr. Caleb Cushing, of Newburyport, in
Massachusetts, to see the emperor, and
make arrangements for a free trade between
the people of China and the
Americans. Mr. Cushing is a very
learned man, and it is pretty likely he
and the emperor will come to a good
understanding. You must know that
the emperor is fond of fine dress, and
expects everybody who comes to see
him, to make a dashing appearance.
Accordingly, Mr. Cushing has carried
out a gay military dress, in which he is
to present himself to the emperor. The
old man is named Taou-Kwang, and is
over seventy years of age. I should
like to see the meeting between him
and Mr. Cushing&mdash;&#8203;shouldn’t you?</p>

<p>When Mr. Cushing comes back, he
will write a book, and tell us all about
China. In the mean time, we shall say
something about a very beautiful place,
called the Kin Shan, or the Golden Island.
This is not far from the city of Nankin,
and near the flourishing city of Quatchou.
It is situated in the river Yangtse-Kiang,
and is famous all over China,
for its beauty. It is about three hundred
feet high, and fifteen hundred in
circuit. It is rocky and precipitous, but
it is shaded with the loveliest trees. It
is also decorated with temples, devoted
to Confucius, Lockien and Fo&mdash;&#8203;the divinities
of Chinese superstition. Here,
also, is a palace, erected by the emperor
Kienlong&mdash;&#8203;the grandfather of Taou-Kwang.
In this he used to spend a great
deal of time, to get away from the cares
of governing such an empire, and to consider
how happy he should be, if he was
only a private individual, and not an
emperor!</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The river, from the top of the Golden
Island, is exceedingly beautiful; and
when Mr. Cushing comes back, we must
get him to tell us all about it. Mr.
Fletcher Webster has gone with Mr.
Cushing, and, as he is a very pleasant,
sociable gentleman, I think he will bring
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pageno">30</span>
us some pretty good stories, too. Perhaps
he and Mr. Cushing will dine with
the emperor, who doesn’t use knives and
forks, but takes up his food with two
sticks, put between the thumb and fingers
of the right hand. These are called
chop-sticks. I hope Mr. Cushing and
Mr. Webster will practise the chop-sticks
before they dine with the emperor; for
if they do not, I am afraid they will get
a poor dinner, and make the emperor
think that the Yankees are rather awkward!
If, indeed, the dinner should consist
of salted angle-worms, bird-nest
soup, Japan leather, balls made of
sharks’ fins, and figured pigeons’ eggs&mdash;&#8203;all
of which are esteemed great delicacies
in China&mdash;&#8203;perhaps the less they can
take up with the chop-sticks, the better
they will like it.</p>

that it has travelled about a thousand miles to

We shall be happy to be made acquainted with

<p class="blockquote"><span class="sc">Mr. Merry</span>:</p>

<p class="blockquote">In this month’s Museum, we find an invitation
to answer twenty questions which you
have proposed, and our indulgent father has
consented to pay the postage if we will find
correct answers and send to you. But how
can you expect children, who live on Rock
River, Illinois, to know a great deal? So, Mr.
Merry, if the answers are not all correct, you
must not laugh at us, but please to tell us, in
the next Museum, what the right answers are;
and, when it is convenient, will you tell us a
little something about the two New Holland
animals?</p>

<p class="blockquote">We have been threatening you with a letter

you had forgotten us, and we should never see

know we cannot get as many books to read as
the children who live east, so we depend upon

<p>The following letter from Washington is
very acceptable, and we hope our little friend
will continue his interesting <span class="lock">correspondence:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="sc">Mr. Merry</span>:</p>

<p class="blockquote">I have come on to Washington with my
father, to spend the winter here, and I thought
I would write, and tell you something about
Washington. It is a pretty large place, but it
is scattered about, and looks like a great city
broken into a great many pieces. The capitol
is situated on the brow of a hill, and is a very
fine building, of white freestone. It is the
handsomest building I ever saw. The grounds
around it are so neat, and have such fine
walks! And then there are so many pretty
trees scattered about in groups! And then
there are beautiful fountains, out of which the
water is spouting as bright as flowing silver!</p>

<p class="blockquote">The capitol is twice as large as the Boston
state-house, and has a vast number of rooms,
and passages, and staircases. I got quite lost
and bewildered in it several times, but I can
find my way pretty well now. There is a
large circular room in the middle of the building,
called the Rotunda. It is lighted at the
top, by the dome or cupola.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Around the sides of the rotunda are several
carvings and pictures. One of the latter represents
the marriage of Pocahontas to Rolfe,
the Englishman. It is a very large picture
indeed, the figures being as large as life. It is
very interesting.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The House of Representatives and the Senate,
being called Congress, meet in two different
rooms in the capitol. The United States
Court also meet every winter in a room in the
capitol.</p>

<p class="blockquote">I have only been to the House of Representatives
yet. The room is a half circle,
very lofty, and supported by beautiful pillars
of many-colored marble. There are about
two hundred and thirty members; and what
strikes me as very odd is, that they sit with
their hats on. If they were boys, they would
have to take their hats off; for boys are expected
to observe good manners, but men and
members of Congress, I suppose, may do as
they please.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The Speaker is Mr. Jones, of Virginia; a
man of dark complexion, and plain appearance.
He is also a little lame. Yet he seems
to be a mild and good man. But there is one
thing that he ought to pay attention to. He
being chairman, the members must address
their speeches to him. When they begin, they
say <em>Mr. Chairman</em>; and sometimes they speak
of addressing the <em>chair</em>. Now, what I notice
as wrong is this, that many of the members
say <em>cheer</em> and <em>cheerman</em>! Would you believe,
Mr. Merry, that such things would be tolerated
in the Congress of the United States? Why,
any school-boy would get a striped jacket for
talking through his nose, and murdering the
English tongue in this fashion; but I suppose
members of Congress may do as they please.</p>

<p class="blockquote">I had the pleasure of hearing Mr. Adams,
of Massachusetts, make a speech. He is very
old, and his hand trembles, and his voice
breaks. I was sorry to see that he got very
angry&mdash;&#8203;very angry indeed. It seems to me
that such an old man should not get angry;
but perhaps I am wrong, for I am only a boy.
I should have loved him, if he had been mild,
and calm, and dignified.</p>

<p class="blockquote">I must now close my letter: perhaps I shall
write you again. Good bye.</p>

<p class="sigright l4">Yours, truly,</p>

<span class="sc">ebruary</span> is upon us; a severe,
unrelenting month, in which
winter seems to reign, in these
northern regions, with resistless
sway. Far to the south,
as in Georgia and Louisiana, the birds
have chosen their mates and are building
their nests; the peas in the gardens
are in blossom; the strawberries are beginning
to form, and the lilacs and roses
are in bloom. But here, alas, the rivers
are in icy fetters&mdash;&#8203;the earth is wrapt in
snow&mdash;&#8203;and not a symptom of starting
vegetation is seen over the whole face of
nature.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that February
should be the coldest month in the year&mdash;&#8203;yet
so it is. In December we have
the shortest days; then the nights are
longest, and the sun bestows upon us
the least warmth; why, then, should not
December be the coldest month? The
reason is this. In February, the heat
has gone from the earth; the frost, ice
and snow have accumulated; and these
exercise an influence which the heat of
the sun cannot yet overcome. If the sun
remained as it is during the winter
months, all vegetation would finally
cease in our climate, and the whole
country would remain buried in snow
and ice.</p>

<p>In England, February has nearly the
same character as our March, and it is
regarded as the opening of spring.
There the birds pair in February, and
the blackbird, thrush and chaffinch fill
the woods with their songs. The ravens
begin to build their nests, the moles
in the ground throw up their little hillocks,
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pageno">34</span>
and some intrepid plants put
forth their blossoms. The snow-drops,
“fair maids of February,” as they are
there called, often peep out, even though
it be amidst the snow&mdash;&#8203;the alder-tree
discloses the flower-buds&mdash;&#8203;and the catkins
of the hazel become conspicuous in
the hedges. This is the picture of
things in <em>old</em> England. What a different
picture is before us in New England!</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Three Sovereigns.</h3>

<p class="p2">The following anecdote was often told
by the late emperor Alexander, and
is amongst the traditions of the Russian
court:</p>

<p>In 1814, during the period that the allies
were masters of Paris, the Czar, who
resided in the hotel of M. de Talleyrand,
was in the daily habit of taking a walk,
(in strict <em>incognito</em>,) every morning, in
the garden of the Tuilleries, and thence
to the Palais Royale. He one day met
two other sovereigns, and the three were
returning arm-in-arm to breakfast in the
Rue <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Florentin, when, on their way
thither, they encountered a provincial,
evidently freshly imported to Paris, and
who had lost his way.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said he, “can you tell
me which is the Tuilleries?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Alexander; “follow
us; we are going that way, and will
show you.”</p>

<p>Thanks on the part of the countryman
led them soon into conversation. A few
minutes sufficed to arrive at the palace;
and as here their routes lay in opposite
directions, they bade each other reciprocally
adieu.</p>

<p>“<cite>Parbleu!</cite>” cried the provincial, “I
should be glad to know the names of
persons so amiable and complaisant as
you are.”</p>

<p>“My name?” said the first&mdash;“Oh,
certainly; you have, perhaps, heard of
me; I am the emperor Alexander.”</p>

<p>“A capital joke,” exclaimed the Gascon&mdash;“An
emperor! And you?” addressing
the second individual,&mdash;&#8203;“Who
may you be?”</p>

<p>“I?” replied he; “why, probably, I
am not wholly unknown to you, at least
by name; I am the king of Prussia!”</p>

<p>“Better and better,” said the man.
“And you, what are you, then?” looking
at the third person.</p>

<p>“I am the emperor of Austria!”</p>

<p>“Perfect, perfect!” exclaimed the provincial,
laughing with all his might.</p>

<p>“But you, monsieur,” said the emperor
Alexander, “surely you will also let
us know whom we have the honor to
speak to?”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” replied the man, quitting
them with an important strut, “I
am the Great Mogul.”</p>

<p class="p2 center">CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="center"><cite>About the Wren and his family.</cite></p>

<p class="drop-img">
<span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_w.jpg"
width="75"
 alt="W" /></span>
<span class="sc">e</span> have given
some account
of this curious,
inquiring,
investigating
little
hero, in a
former volume
of our
Museum. But there is a good deal to
tell about him yet; and, as I have many
letters from my little readers, expressing
their interest in Jack, I propose to go on
and continue his story. I think everybody
will be pleased to hear how he
became acquainted with the natural history
of birds.</p>

<p>One day Jack was down at the bottom
of the garden, when he became interested
in some insects which he saw on the
leaves of a hop vine, which was climbing
up a trellis close by. In order to
examine the insects more closely, Jack
took off his cap and carelessly hung it
on the top of one of the stakes which
supported the trellis.</p>

<p>After examining the insects for a
while, Jack became so interested in the
subject that he picked off some leaves of
the hop vine, covered with the little
creatures, and carried them to his aunt
Piper, to ask her about them. He forgot
his cap, which was left on the stake;
nor could Jack recollect, when he
wanted it, where he had left it. He was
obliged to wear his best hat for nearly a
week, when, by chance, he discovered
his cap on the stake. He then recollected
all about it, and ran to the trellis
to take it down. But what was his surprise
to find it tenanted by a fierce little
wren, who flew out of the cap and then
darted at Jack, snapping at him sharply
with his tiny beak.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i014.jpg"
 width="50%"
 alt="Wren"
 />
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Jack was almost frightened at the
fierceness of the little bird, but after
a while he reached up his hand and
took down the cap. You may well believe
that he was greatly amused to find
that the little wren, with its companion,
had begun to build a nest in it.
They had already packed it more than
half full of sticks, straws, and dried
grass.</p>

<p>At first, Jack was sorry that he had
robbed the little birds of their home;
but after a while, he got a little box
and made a hole large enough for the
wrens to go in and out, and set it upon
<span class="pageno">36</span>
the stake where the cap had been. For
two or three days the wrens were very
shy, and would not go near the box. But
at last, one of them flew to the trellis and
peered all about to see if there was no
danger near. In a little while, <a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a> he hitched
along towards the box, making a queer
noise all the time. By and by, he ventured
to alight upon the box, and finally
he popped his head into the hole. Then
he looked all around again very cautiously,
and at last in he went. Pretty
soon he came out again, and stationed
himself upon the top of the box, and
began to sing with all his might. If
you will excuse me, I will try to put his
song into words:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Hi diddle ho diddle,</div>
<div class="i1">Pop diddle dee,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Here’s the prettiest house</div>
<div class="i1">You ever did see.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Come hither, come hither,</div>
<div class="i1">My own pretty friend,</div>
<div class="i1">Here’s a home for us both,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Come, come, little wren!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Here’s a hole for our door,</div>
<div class="i1">And a room for our nest,</div>
<div class="i1">So come my sweet bird,</div>
<div class="i1">And we both will be blest.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Hi diddle ho diddle,</div>
<div class="i1">Pop diddle dee,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis the prettiest house</div>
<div class="i1">You ever did see!</div>
</div><!--end stanza-->

<p>Thus the little fellow went on singing
as if he would split his throat, and pretty
soon his little mate was seen flying along
toward him. She alighted upon the box,
and nothing could exceed his apparent
delight. Mr. Wren then popped into
the box, and Mrs. Wren popped in after
him.</p>

<p>Jack was an attentive observer of all
these proceedings, and he was greatly
delighted to find that the wrens were
willing to accept of the box in exchange
for the cap. The next day, they began
to build their nest in the box. It was
very pleasant, indeed, to see the little
creatures at work. They would carry
up quite large sticks, and were very
handy in getting them into the hole.
They began their work by sunrise, and
so industrious were they, that, in four
days, the nest was finished. The lower
part consisted of rough sticks and coarse
straws. The upper part was finer, and
the nest was lined with fine grass. In a
week, there were four little spotted eggs
in the nest. The female wren was now
rather quiet, but the male wren was very
watchful indeed. If he saw the cat
coming near the trellis, he would fly at
her, and snap his little beak close to her
ears. Puss would sometimes strike her
paws at him, but, in general, she was
frightened and ran away. The little
wren was very pugnacious. If a robin
or a blue jay came near, he went at him
in the most fearless way, and drove him
off. One day, as Jack was watching
him, the little fellow attacked a crow that
was passing by, and, overtaking him,
picked at him so sharply as to make the
old fellow cry for quarter in a very loud
voice. “Caw, caw, caw,” said the crow,
and Mr. Wren, seeming satisfied, returned
to his box. Perching himself
upon the very top of the trellis, he began
to sing a song of triumph, shaking his
wings all the time, in great glee.</p>

<p>The female wren soon began to sit
<span class="pageno">37</span>
upon the eggs, and nothing could exceed
the watchful care and anxiety of good
master Wren. He was always on hand,
if any cat or bird intruded upon his
dominions; and they were sure to pay
dearly for their temerity when they did
so. He spent a good deal of his time
in singing, in part, I suppose, to amuse
himself, and in part also to amuse his
little lady.</p>

<p>Well, after a time, there were four
young birds in the nest, and both Mr.
and Mrs. Wren were too busy in feeding
their children, to sing or play. They
caught flies, and moths, and spiders, and
gave them to their young ones, and it
was amazing to see what a sight of these
insects the little wrens ate, and it was
really amusing to see how serious the
old wrens appeared to be about these
days.</p>

<p>The little ones grew apace, and in a
short time it was thought best for them
to leave the nest. You may well
believe that Jack was on the look-out, to
see the little creatures in their first
adventure forth into the world. In the
first place, one of the young birds put
his head through the door of the box,
and looked all round to see if the coast
was clear. It was amazing to see how
cunning the little fellow was, though not
more than a fortnight old. The old
wrens were at a little distance, chattering
at a great rate, and seeming to invite the
little fellow to try his wing. At last, he
took courage, leaped from the box, and
alighted safely upon a fence at some
distance.</p>

<p>Now, how do you think this little bird
knew how to fly,&mdash;&#8203;where to go,&mdash;&#8203;and
how to ’light upon the fence? for you
must remember that he had never been
out of the box before. I suppose you
will tell me that he was guided by
instinct&mdash;&#8203;that strange power given by
the Creator; and you will tell me right.
After the first one had departed, the others
came out one by one, and all were
successful in their first flight, except the
last. This little fellow, in attempting to
light upon the fence, missed his footing,
and fell to the ground. The old wrens
came to him immediately, and there was
a prodigious chattering about what had
happened. The little fellow looked very
serious for a time, but at last he made a
new effort, flew a little distance, and
reached one of the lower rails of the
fence. The old wrens cheered him
with their approbation, put a big spider
into his mouth, and he seemed to be
quite happy.</p>

<p>This was a great day among the wren
family. Never was there such a bustle
before! The little wrens kept calling
out for something to eat; the old wrens
flew first to one and then to another,
giving each an insect with a little good
advice, and departing to provide more
food.</p>

<p>It would take me a long time to tell
all that happened upon this interesting
occasion. Jack was there, and saw it
all, and if you ever meet with him, you
had better ask him about it. I can only
tell you, at present, that, from this time,
he was very much interested in birds;
not as creatures to be hunted and tormented
or killed, but as creatures that
build nests, and have their homes, and
rear their young ones, which they love
very much, and whom they treat with the
utmost care and tenderness. He looked
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pageno">38</span>
upon them as creatures displaying great
ingenuity, many curious habits and wonderful
instincts. He, therefore, found a
great deal more pleasure in watching
their movements, and studying their
characters, than in throwing stones at
them, or shooting them. I shall tell you
about other birds as we proceed in our
story.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Dick Boldhero.</h3>

<p class="p2 center">CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="center"><cite>Early days&mdash;The keg of gold&mdash;Misfortunes&mdash;&#8203;Voyages.</cite></p>

<p class="p2 dropcap negindent">A<span class="sc">s</span> I am about to tell my story, it is
proper that I should say something
of my birth, parentage and early
days. About half way between
Hartford and New Haven, in Connecticut,
is a small, pleasant city, called Middletown.
It is situated upon the western
bank of Connecticut river, and lies
upon the turnpike which constitutes the
great avenue between the two places first
mentioned.</p>

<p>About a mile and a half south of Middletown,
upon this high road, is a turnpike
gate, and contiguous to it is a small
toll-house. This was originally called
Hill-gate, being situated on a hill, but
at last it was familiarly called Hell-gate.
In the house which bore this ominous
title, I was born, about five and
forty years ago.</p>

<p>Our family then consisted of my father
and mother, a brother, named
Seth, and myself. Seth was two years
old when I was born. When I was
about two years old, a girl was added to
our circle, and she was named Sarah.
We were now very poor, but had once
been in good circumstances. My father
had formerly been a merchant in Middletown,
in partnership with his brother
Benjamin. They traded to the West
Indies, with a sloop called the Carbuncle,
and my uncle Ben used to command
her. He usually went to <abbr title="Santo">St.</abbr> Domingo,
where he carried horses, mules, cows,
oxen, potatoes, onions, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, and brought
back sugar and molasses.</p>

<p>From all I can learn, it seems my uncle
Ben was an eccentric character, but still
he managed his part of the business well,
and the concern went on in a thriving
way for some years. At last, it was
thought best for him to remain at <abbr title="Santo">St.</abbr>
Domingo, so as to carry on the business
there, and accordingly it was so arranged.
He took up his residence at
Port au Prince; but, in about a year
after he was established there, the insurrection
in <abbr title="Santo">St.</abbr> Domingo broke out. My
uncle, who was a hot-headed fellow,
took some part in the struggle, in consequence
of which, he was obliged to
seek safety in flight from the island.
Whither he went, we could not exactly
find out, but we were told that he went
on board a Dutch vessel, bound for Surinam.
From that time, however, we
heard nothing of him.</p>

<p>At the time that the disturbances
commenced at Port au Prince, the Carbuncle
was lying in port. Her cargo
was in, and she was almost ready to
sail; accordingly, she took her departure,
and escaped. She brought a letter
from my uncle Ben, very hastily written,
saying that his life was in danger, and
<span class="pageno">39</span>
very probably he might never return.
He went on to say, however, that he
should send a keg of gold by the vessel,
which was of great value; that, if my
father never heard of him more, he
might consider it as his own.</p>

<p>You may well imagine my father’s
disappointment, at finding that the precious
keg was not to be found on board
the sloop, when she came back. The
supercargo, whose name was Ambrose
Dexter, and familiarly called Amby Dexter,
declared that my uncle had not time
to put the keg on board,&mdash;&#8203;that he was
obliged to fly, and that he went hastily
by night on board the Dutch vessel of
which we have already spoken.</p>

<p>My father continued the business for
a year or two, employing Dexter as his
supercargo; but the trade proved unprofitable,
and at last he became a bankrupt.
The idea was then common that
the creditor has a right over the soul
and body of his debtor. Accordingly,
the persons whom he owed threw him
into prison, where he remained for two
or three years. My mother was reduced
to extreme poverty, but she still continued
to pick up a subsistence.</p>

<p>Upon my father’s failure, Dexter took
the store and continued the business,
and very soon he became a rich man.
For some reason, he seemed to hate my
father, though he pretended to be very
kind to him. He used to go and see
him in prison, and promised to use his
influence for his liberation; but it afterwards
appeared that he had actually
bought up claims against him, and
caused him to be imprisoned upon
them.</p>

<p>My father suffered so much from his
confinement, that his constitution was
weakened, and his health impaired forever.
After his release, he obtained the
situation of toll-keeper, from which he
received about one hundred dollars a
year. Upon this pittance, our family
was now obliged to live. My mother,
however, was a good economist, and
though we lived humbly, we had still
the necessaries of life.</p>

<p>As I have said, Amby Dexter advanced
rapidly in wealth, and in the
space of a few years he became a very
rich man. In reflecting upon all the
circumstances, my father became suspicious
that he had embezzled the keg of
gold, which had been sent by my uncle
Ben, and that this was the secret of his
sudden prosperity. He intimated these
views, in a confidential way, to one or
two whom he esteemed friends. He
showed them the letter he had received
from his brother, together with the documents
tending to establish his views.
These confidential friends, however, betrayed
his trust, and told Dexter of what
my father had said.</p>

<p>As if our cup of misfortune was not
yet sufficiently full, our house was secretly
entered shortly after this time, by
some one at night, and my father’s papers
were carried off, together with two
hundred dollars, which belonged to the
turnpike company. A story was soon
put in circulation, that the robbery was
all a sham; and it was soon generally
suspected that my father had taken the
money, and caused the rumor of the
theft to cover up his guilt. He was
tried for the embezzlement of the property,
but though he was acquitted, he
was deprived of his place.</p>

<p><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pageno">40</span>
Nor was this all. Dexter brought an
action against him for defamation, in
consequence of what he had said about
him to his confidential neighbors. A
poor man’s word is feeble, and carries
little conviction with it; while the rich
man’s word is full of authority. Accordingly,
in this contest, my father could
hardly fail to be overwhelmed by his
proud and prosperous enemy. He had
even lost the papers, by means of the
robbery, which justified the suspicions
he had expressed, and thus he was regarded
by the jury as without excuse
or defence.</p>

<p>He was sentenced to pay five hundred
dollars, and being unable to do
it, he was sent to prison. Here he lingered
for a few months, till, at last, worn
out and emaciated with confinement,
and sick at heart, his spirit departed,
as I trust, for a better world.</p>

<p>As it is a painful story, I shall not
detail the course of events which followed,
in respect to my mother. It
must be sufficient to say, that my brother
Seth grew up rather a wild fellow, and
the neighbors said&mdash;“I thought it would
be so, for he comes of a bad father.” At
last, when he was about seventeen years
old, he went to sea, and was not heard
of afterwards. For myself, I went to
school till I was nine years old, when I
went, as cabin-boy, on board a vessel
which plied between Middletown and
New York. Here I continued for several
years&mdash;&#8203;though I was often beaten
because they said I belonged to a bad
family. They seemed to think I could do
nothing right. However, I bore it all,
and grew up a sailor. When I was
about fifteen, I went on a voyage to <abbr title="Santo">St.</abbr>
Domingo, and was instructed by my
mother to make inquiries about my
uncle at Port au Prince. This I did,
but as it was about twenty years since
the events occurred which I have mentioned,
I could hear nothing of him.</p>

<p>After my return, I made several other
voyages, and was soon able to do something
towards the support of my mother
and sister. At last I went upon a
voyage which produced results which
may be interesting to the reader. I
shall give an account of it in the next
chapter.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="h3head">The Indian and his Dog.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">O<span class="sc">n</span> the borders of the state of Pennsylvania
there lived a man by the name
of Le Fevre, who had a family of
eleven children. One morning, the
youngest of these, about four years of
age, was found to be missing. The distressed
family sought after him, by the
river and in the fields, but to no purpose.
Terrified to an extreme degree,
they united with their neighbors to go
in quest of him. They entered the
woods, and beat them over with the
most scrupulous attention. A thousand
times they called him by name, but
were answered only by the echoes of
the wilderness.</p>

<p>The different members of the party
employed in the search, at length assembled
themselves together, without
being able to bring the least intelligence
of the child. After reposing for a
few minutes, they formed themselves
into several different bands, and renewed
the search. Night came on, but the
<span class="pageno">41</span>
parents refused to return home. Their
anxiety increased by knowing that the
forests were inhabited by panthers and
wolves, and they could not but paint to
their imagination the horrid spectacle
of some of these dreadful animals devouring
their darling child.</p>

<p>“Derick, my poor little Derick, where
are you?” frequently exclaimed the
mother, in the most poignant grief,&mdash;&#8203;but
all was of no avail. As soon as daylight
appeared, they recommenced their
search, but as unsuccessfully as the preceding
day. At last, an Indian, laden
with furs, coming from an adjacent village,
called at the house of Le Fevre,
intending to repose himself there, as he
usually did, in his travels through that
part of the country. He was much surprised
to find no one at home but an old
negress, kept there by her infirmities.</p>

<p>“Where is my brother?” asked the
Indian. “Alas!” replied the negro
woman, “he has lost little Derick, and
all the neighborhood are employed in
looking after him in the woods.” It
was then three o’clock, in the afternoon.
“Sound the horn,” said the Indian,
“and try to call your master home&mdash;&#8203;I
will find his child.” The horn was
sounded, and, as soon as the father returned,
the Indian asked him for the
stockings and shoes that the little Derick
had worn last. He then ordered his
dog, which he had brought with him, to
smell them, and immediately proceeded
to describe a circle of nearly a mile in
diameter, ordering his dog to smell the
earth wherever he went.</p>

<p>The circle was not completed, when
the sagacious animal began to bark.
This sound occasioned some feeble ray
of hope to the disconsolate parents.
The dog followed the scent and barked
again; the party pursued him with all
their speed, but they soon lost sight of
him in the woods. Half an hour afterwards,
they heard him again, and soon
saw him return. The countenance of
the dog was visibly altered; an air of
joy seemed to animate him, and his actions
appeared to indicate that his search
had not been in vain. “I am sure that
he has found the child!” exclaimed the
Indian. But whether dead or alive, was
a question which none could yet decide.
The Indian then followed his dog, who
led him to the foot of a large tree, where
lay the child, exhausted from weakness
and want of food, and nearly approaching
death. He took it tenderly in his
arms, and hastened to the parents.</p>

<p>Happily, the father and mother were
in some measure prepared for the return
of their child. Their joy was so great,
that it was more than a quarter of an
hour before they could express their
gratitude to the restorer of their child.
Words cannot describe the affecting
scene. After they had bathed the face
of the child with their tears, they threw
themselves on the neck of the Indian, to
whom they were no much indebted.
Their gratitude was then extended to
the dog; they caressed him with inexpressible
delight, as the animal, who, by
means of his sagacity, had found their
beloved offspring; and, conceiving that
he, like the rest of the group, must now
stand in need of refreshment, a plentiful
repast was prepared for him; after which,
he and his master pursued their journey;
and the company, mutually pleased
at the happy event, returned to their respective
homes, delighted with the kind
Indian and his wonderful dog.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Husking the Corn.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">H<span class="sc">ere</span> they are, all at work, husking the
corn&mdash;&#8203;the Widow Wilkins and her
three children, Tom, Dick and Lucy.
The good woman is giving a lesson
to Dick, how to strip off the husks&mdash;&#8203;and
little Lucy is trying to do as Dick
does. Let us listen to the dialogue.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mother.</span> See there, Dick&mdash;&#8203;do you see
that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dick.</span> Yes, ma’am.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M.</span> Well&mdash;&#8203;now you take off the
husks, and then take hold of the stalk,
just so.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">D.</span> Yes, ma’am.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M.</span> And then you break off the stalk
close to the ear, just so.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">D.</span> Yes, ma’am.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucy.</span> There, mother! didn’t I do
that better’n Dick?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M.</span> Yes, my darling. Now, Dick, do
you know how to do it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">D.</span> Yes, ma’am.</p>

<p>Being satisfied that the husking was
in a fair way, the widow Wilkins departed,
and left her children to themselves.
After she was gone, Dick spoke
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pageno">43</span>
as follows. “Can you tell me, Tom,
what all this corn is for?” “To be
sure I can!” said Tom: “some of it is
to feed the chickens with; some of it is
to feed the pigs with; some of it is to
feed the horse and cow with, and some
of it is to be ground into Indian meal, to
make Johnny-cake and brown bread
with.”</p>

<p>“Well done!” says Dick. “It seems
to me that the corn is very useful, then;
for the chickens and the pigs, and the
cow and the horse, and mother and Tom,
and Dick and Lucy, all live upon it.
Really, I never thought of that before.
Then people, when they plant and
plough, and hoe, and pick, and husk the
corn, are working all the while for the
hens, and hogs, and cattle, and people!”</p>

<p>“Yes, to be sure,” said Tom; “and
what did you think all this labor was
for, before you found out it was useful
in this way?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said the boy, “I thought&mdash;&#8203;I
thought&mdash;&#8203;I don’t know what I thought;
I guess I didn’t think at all&mdash;&#8203;or if I did,
I thought it was all a kind of play. But
I know better now; I see that when
people are at work, they are not playing,
but they are doing something useful;
and when mother sets me to work, I
mean always to consider that she has a
good and useful object in view, and that
I must do it, not because it is play, but
because it will do some good.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Tom; “I hope you
will always do so.” By this time, the
husking was done, and I came away.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Old Man in the Corner; or, the Pedler’s Pack,</h3>

<p class="center"><abbr title="Number Two">NO. II.</abbr></p>

<p class="center">THE STORY OF THE COTTON-WOOL.</p>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">S<span class="sc">everal</span> weeks ago I took a ramble
through the beautiful town of Dorchester.
In the course of my perambulation,
I came to a paper-mill,
and being attracted by the stirring sound
of the machinery within, I entered and
looked around me. In one place I saw
an immense bin of rags, of all sizes and
shapes, and of all hues, and apparently
gathered from the four quarters of the
globe. Never did I see such a motley
congregation, crowded together in one
place. As I was looking on the heap,
the thought occurred to me that if each
rag could speak and tell the adventures
of its existence, we should have a collection
of romances equal in extent, and
perhaps rivalling in wonders, the thousand
and one tales of the Arabian
Nights.</p>

<p>While I was gazing at the heap of
rags, which, by the by, was in a dim
and dusky room, I thought I saw something
rise up in the midst, looking very
much like the skinny visage of a very
thin, old woman, about to speak. I approached
the bin, and looked steadily
at the grisly image&mdash;&#8203;but, on closer inspection,
it appeared to be only an old
rag, which had, accidentally, assumed
the questionable shape I have described.</p>

<p>I proceeded to examine the several
<span class="pageno">44</span>
processes of the mill, and great was my
admiration at seeing their magical result.
I discovered that the rags of any hue,
being put into a vat, were bleached as
white as the “driven snow;” that they
were then reduced to a kind of pulp, as
soft as paste; that this, being mixed with
water, produced a liquid like milk; that
this liquid passed over a wire cloth,
through which the water oozed, leaving
a thin, white, even scum, which, settling
upon the wire cloth, formed the sheet
of paper.</p>

<p>I looked on this beautiful process with
wonder and delight. I saw the sheet
of paper pass over several cylinders,
gradually becoming firmer and firmer,
by pressure and heat, until, at last, I
could see it coiled up, smooth, white and
polished, and several hundred yards in
length. I then saw it unrolled, and, by
a simple machine, cut into sheets, ready
to be sent to market.</p>

<p>I have never seen any manufacture
which seemed to me no admirable.
When I left the mill, I sauntered along
the banks of the river, which turned the
wheels of the mill. The place was
shady, and, it being summer, I sat down.
While I was there, a pretty, black-eyed
girl came along, and I beckoned her to
me. She came smiling, and we fell
into conversation. She asked me to go
to her house, and being introduced to her
parents, they gave the old man some
food, and treated him kindly. “Will
you tell me a story?” said the little girl.
“I will write you one,” said I&mdash;&#8203;and so
we parted.</p>

<p>For some weeks I forgot my promise,
when I received a note from the black-eyed
girl, refreshing my memory on this
point. At evening I sat down to write
the tale: but, instead of writing, a
drowsiness stole over me, and I fell into
a dream. Methought I was at my
writing-desk, when I heard a rustling
amid a heap of papers on my table, and
presently something rose up, and assumed
precisely the appearance of the
rag in the bin of the paper-mill, which
had seemed to me so much like a haggish
old woman. A sort of strange fear
came over me. I could now see the
distinct features of a face, though the
general aspect of the horrid visage was
that of an old calico rag. There was a
long, thin, crooked nose; deep, twinkling,
tallow-colored eyes; a pointed chin,
and a mouth that seemed capable of
uttering unutterable things.</p>

<p>I rose up and stood aloof in fear. I
was about to speak, when the ghost put
her finger on her lip, and, stepping forward,
stood upon the middle of the table.
There was something awful about this
scene, and I felt chilled, with a creeping
horror, to my very heart. The creature
reached out a kind of crumpled hand,
and in a sort of frenzy I clasped it. But
no sooner had I touched it, than the
image vanished, and I found in my
grasp a roll of paper. This I unfolded,
and found it to be an immense sheet,
written over in a neat, close hand. Casting
my eye at the beginning, I saw that
it read as follows:</p>

<p class="center">“THE REMINISCENCES OF A RAG.</p>

<p>“As the rising sun was just peeping
over the bosom of the Atlantic, and
tinging with gold the waters that play
along the borders of Amelia Island, a
negro man, named Bob Squash, was seen
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pageno">45</span>
putting some little seeds into the ground,
upon the eastern slope of said island.
This event occurred on the 4th of March,
1839, as the wooden clock of the plantation
was on the stroke of four.</p>

<p>“The seed was covered up in the
ground, but in a few days it shot forth,
and, in process of time, it became a
large plant, covered with tufts of cotton.
These were gathered by Bob Squash,
and rolled into a wad and from this
time I began to have a consciousness of
existence. That ball of cotton was myself.
I was packed into a bag with an
immense heap of other cotton, and being
put into a mill, we were awfully torn to
pieces, in order to separate the seeds
from the fibres. The teeth of the mill,
which consisted of a thousand hooks,
went through and through us, and thus
we were parted forever from the seeds
which had been born and bred with us,
and which we had cherished from our
infancy. The seeds, however, were
black, and the combing process made us
look very nice and clean.</p>

<p>“I was now taken, with the rest of the
cotton-wool, and put into a large, coarse
sack, and, in order to make us lie snug,
a little negro got into the sack and trod
us down. He didn’t stop to consider
how we might like it, but he went on
stamping and jumping, and singing Jim
Crow, all the time. When the bag was
full, the mouth was sewed up, and we
were marked as weighing three hundred
and seventy-five pounds. In this state
we were called a bale of cotton.</p>

<p>“You must know that there are two
kinds of cotton&mdash;&#8203;the short staple, or <dfn>upland
cotton</dfn>, and the long staple, or <dfn>sea
island</dfn>. The latter is the best, and our
bale was of that sort. Of course, we,
being of the aristocratic class, were proud
of our descent; and, while we supposed
the vulgar upland would be worked
up into shirtings and sheetings, or, perhaps,
cheap calicoes, we expected to be
treated according to our quality, by
being wrought into delicate muslins or
cambrics for the fair. So it chanced, as
you shall see, if you will peruse the
next chapter.”</p>

<p class="center smaller">[To be continued.]</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="sc">The Sea.</span>&mdash;From the great depths
which have been actually ascertained in
some places, and the great extent of sea
in which no bottom has been found, we
may conclude that we are under the
estimate when, including banks and
shallows, we allow one mile in depth
for the whole. Even this gives us a
most enormous quantity of water; a
quantity which, estimated in tons weight,
we have the entire quantity of sea water,
with all its saline ingredients, amounting
to the enormous weight of 600,000,000,000,000,000,
(six hundred thousand billions
of tons.) Of this enormous quantity,
between three and four per cent. consists
of different saline ingredients, and the
rest of pure water; so that water in the
sea available for the purposes of animal
and vegetable life, the supply of springs
and rivers, and all other purposes for
which water is needed in the economy
of the land, amounts to five hundred and
eighty thousand billions of tons; and
the quantity of salt, at least of saline
ingredients, to about twenty thousand
billions of tons.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Snow-balling.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">“H<span class="sc">urrah</span>, boys&mdash;&#8203;school’s out! come!
let’s choose sides and have a
snow-balling!”</p>

<p>At this challenge, the boys divide
into two groups, and at it they go.
It is capital sport&mdash;&#8203;for while it gives an
opportunity for the display of skill and
power in hurling the missiles, it causes
no broken bones&mdash;&#8203;no bloody noses&mdash;&#8203;no
peeled shins&mdash;&#8203;no black eyes. It is the
very mildest, merriest, and most harmless
of all fighting. A snow-ball pat in
the face draws no “claret,” begets no
bad blood, and only provokes a retaliation,
in kind, perchance inciting the hit
warrior to squeeze his ball a little harder
and send it back with redoubled, but still
harmless <em>vim</em>.</p>

<p>Those people who live in the sunny
south, where Jack Frost never comes
with his snow-flakes, surely miss one
of the greatest delights of our northern
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pageno">47</span>
climes. We are willing to forego their
orange groves, their fig trees, and their
grape vines&mdash;&#8203;bending as they may be
with fruit&mdash;&#8203;in consideration of the fun
of snow-balling. Not that we, ourself&mdash;&#8203;Robert
Merry&mdash;&#8203;old, decrepit and gray&mdash;&#8203;ever
engage in that lively sport. No&mdash;&#8203;such
things are past with us; but though
we cannot personally engage in such
merry work, we can at least look on&mdash;&#8203;and
that is a great pleasure.</p>

<p>I remember once when I was at school,
the boys agreed to have a game of snow-balling,
and each one was only to use
his left hand. The work went on bravely
and smartly, too, for some time; each
boy stuck to the treaty, and faithfully
worked with his left hand. But, at last,
one cowardly fellow, named Farwell,
got into a tussle with another chap, and
as he received more balls than he sent,
he broke his faith, and hurled with his
right hand. This provoked retaliation,
for one act of injustice is apt to beget
another. Farwell was soundly beaten,
and in a short time the whole treaty was
violated and overturned. I have often
thought of that little incident&mdash;&#8203;and I
close my story by suggesting the lesson
it inculcates; beware of injustice&mdash;&#8203;for
it is very likely that you will yourself
suffer from the wrongs that will be done
in retaliation.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="sc">Anecdote of Washington.</span>&mdash;At the
commencement of the revolutionary war,
there lived at East Windsor, Connecticut,
a farmer, of the name of Jacob Munsell,
aged forty-five years. After the
communication by water between this
part of the country and Boston was interrupted
by the possession of Boston
harbor by the British fleet, Munsell was
often employed to transport provisions by
land to our army, lying in the neighborhood
of Boston. In the summer of
1775, while thus employed, he arrived
within a few miles of the camp at Cambridge,
with a large load, drawn by a
stout ox team. In a part of the road
which was somewhat rough, he met two
carriages, in each of which was an
American general officer. The officer
in the forward carriage, when near to
Munsell, put his head out of the window,
and called to him, in an authoritative
tone&mdash;“Get out of the path!”</p>

<p>Munsell immediately retorted, “I won’t
get out of the path&mdash;&#8203;get out yourself!”</p>

<p>After some other vain attempts to prevail
on Munsell to turn out, the officer’s
carriage turned out, and Munsell kept
the path. The other carriage immediately
came up, having been within hearing
distance of what had passed, and the
officer within put his head out of the vehicle,
and said to Munsell&mdash;“My friend,
the road is bad, and it is very difficult
for me to turn out; will you be so good
as to turn out and let me pass?”</p>

<p>“With all my heart, sir,” said Munsell;
“but I won’t be d&mdash;&mdash;d out of the
path by any man.”</p>

<p>This last officer was General Washington.
How much more noble, and
how much more successful, is a mild and
courteous manner, than a harsh and dictatorial
one!</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Use of Telescopes.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">O<span class="sc">ne</span> of the inventions most important to
science that ever was made, was that
of the <em>telescope</em>. The common telescope
is usually called a spy-glass. It
is used to look at distant objects, and it
serves to bring them, apparently, nearer
to view. At sea, the spy-glass is of the
greatest use, for it enables the masters
of vessels distinctly to see the land,
which would scarcely be visible to the
naked eye. He can also see vessels
which are distant, and be able to tell
what kind of vessels they are, what
rigging they have, what colors they
carry, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, long before these things
could be discovered by the naked eye.</p>

<p>But the telescopes, made for looking at
the heavenly bodies, though apparently
less useful than the common spy-glass,
have still revealed to us many interesting
and wonderful, and, indeed, useful,
truths. By means of these, we are better
acquainted with the moon; we
now know that it is a rough planet of
mountains and valleys, and, though resembling
our earth, that it is without
inhabitants, water or atmosphere.</p>

<p>By means of telescopes we know that
<span class="pageno">49</span>
Jupiter, which to the naked eye seems
but a little star, is a great world, with
four moons, and, what is curious, we
know that these moons keep the same
face always turned to the planet, just as
our moon does to the earth. We know
that Saturn, which also seems like a
little star, is a vast world, with seven
moons, and a wonderful belt of light,
encircling it and revolving around it.
These are some of the wonders revealed
to us by the telescope.</p>

<p>But there are still others quite as
interesting. Beyond the stars which
we can see with the naked eye, the
telescope unfolds to the view thousands
upon thousands of others, the very existence
of which we had never known
but for this instrument. Nor is even
this all&mdash;&#8203;some of the stars are not single,
but two or three are close together, and
evidently revolve around one another.
These are called <em>binary</em>, or double stars.
Astronomers have observed many thousands
of these wonderful worlds, far
away in the boundless regions of space.</p>

<p>You have all seen what is called the
Milky-way, a broad, irregular band of
light crossing the entire heavens. The
ancient poets represented this as the
milk spilt by the nurse of their god
Mercury, and from this poor and paltry
conception, it derived its name. Now,
let us remark what the telescope says
the milky-way is&mdash;&#8203;an immense number,
myriads upon myriads, of worlds! What
a glorious view does this unfold to us
of that God who has not only made the
heavens, but us also!</p>

<p>But beside stars of various magnitudes,
revealed by the telescope, there
are other objects, called <em>nebulæ</em>, from
their cloud-like appearance. These are
of various sizes and forms, some being
without defined shape, some being circular,
some long and pointed, and one
bearing a resemblance to a dumb bell.
The engraving at the head of this article
will give some idea of the appearance
of these mysterious bodies, which are
seen, many millions of miles off in the
far regions of space.</p>

<p>The idea has been suggested, and
with good reason, that these <em>nebulæ</em> are
particles of matter, thin almost as air,
which are in the process of being condensed
and formed into worlds. We
know that a detached drop of water
forms itself, at once, into a little globe,
by that principle which pervades all
matter&mdash;&#8203;called gravitation; and we may
suppose that these different particles
forming the nebulæ, being attracted to
each other, will gradually assume a
spherical form, and that, in the rush of
these particles toward each other, currents
will be created, which will give the
globe a revolving motion. Such are the
curious speculations of the astronomers,
and there is some reason to think them
correct. What a vast conception does
this view of things unfold&mdash;&#8203;for it seems
that not only are there countless millions
of worlds already formed, all around us,
but that, in the distance, the Almighty
is still carrying on the stupendous process
of manufacturing other worlds!
Far&mdash;&#8203;far beyond the reach of the naked
eye&mdash;&#8203;far beyond the reach of the searching
telescope&mdash;&#8203;far beyond even the
daring stretch of the imagination, into
the unfathomed night of space&mdash;&#8203;there,
there, is the Almighty lighting up the
regions of nothingness with existence,
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pageno">50</span>
bidding new suns to shine in the chambers
of silence and death&mdash;&#8203;and thus extending
his dominions and spreading
abroad the rays of his glory. If the
angels and good spirits are permitted to
look upon these things&mdash;&#8203;to accompany
the Creator in his mighty movements
to look upon his proceedings&mdash;&#8203;to fathom,
in some degree, his designs&mdash;&#8203;to participate
in his works&mdash;&#8203;to co-operate in his
views&mdash;&#8203;and to do all this in that blissful
harmony which love to God creates&mdash;&#8203;O,
how glorious must be that happiness
which they enjoy!</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Lotus.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">he</span> Lotus, or lily of the Nile, is a
plant of great beauty and celebrity.
There is one kind which is dried
and made into loaves, and eaten for
bread. The root, which is round and
of the size of an apple, is also eaten.</p>

<p>The flower, at first, stands on the
stalk, one or two feet above the water;
but when the leaves are expanded and
the seed-vessels fully formed, it gradually
sinks till it rests on the surface of
the water. All travellers are very much
struck with the beauty of the lakes and
rivers in Egypt, when, as frequently
happens, they are covered with these
blossoms. Sometimes they spring up
in the places which are flooded during
the overflow of the Nile, and seem to
spread out to a vast extent, covering the
entire surface of the water; yet when the
flood subsides they perish.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Indian Dandy.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">I<span class="sc">t</span> must not be supposed that the love
of fine dress is confined to city dandies
and dandisettes. By no means;
for travellers tell us that among the
tribes that inhabit the far west, the
young Indian men have a great fancy
for dressing themselves up in a fanciful
way.</p>

<p>The picture at the head of this article
represents a young man whose name
was Prairie Wolf, and it is a very good
likeness. He has upon his head the
horns of a buffalo, which he slew in the
chase; and beneath is the hair of the
buffalo’s pate, with a circular and
notched piece of leather, forming together
a sort of crown. He has beads
around his neck, with a necklace of
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pageno">52</span>
bears’ claws. He has, also, a bracelet
on his left arm. His robe is made of
ornamented deer skins;&mdash;&#8203;his kilt is of
leather, fringed with wampum.</p>

<p>This dress is very modest for a young
Indian. Very often the young fellows,
when they wish to appear lovely in the
eyes of the girls, paint themselves red,
blue and green: they decorate their
heads with feathers, and, altogether,
make a most extraordinary display.
They then mount a horse and ride
swiftly around the village, coming often
before the women to excite their admiration.</p>

<p>The grave old warriors and hunters,
who have done great deeds in their day,
laugh at such things, and ridicule them
as very contemptible. Indeed, when an
Indian has performed some distinguished
feat in battle, or the chase, he usually
ceases to be a dandy in dress.</p>

<p>One thing is curious among the Indians,
and that is, that this love of dress
is chiefly confined to the men. The
women, indeed, decorate themselves
with a few beads and other ornaments;
but real dandyism belongs wholly to the
other sex. The females are usually
modest in their attire, and seldom seek
to excite admiration by their dress. It
seems to be among the Indians as among
the turkies&mdash;&#8203;the cocks are the only ones
that strut about, showing off their fine
feathers!</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Locust.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">he</span> <em>Locust</em> is an insect whose vast
depredations are so little known to
us by experience, that the full extent
of the plague they cause in Egypt
and other eastern countries, is hardly
credible. A flight of these insects has
been compared to flakes of snow driven
about by the wind; and if the sun shines
ever so bright, it is no lighter than
when covered by a cloud. When they
alight upon the ground, the plains are
entirely covered with them, and speedily
stripped of every vestige of herbage or
other vegetable; while at night, locusts
cover the earth in such numbers, that
they lie one upon the other, four or five
inches thick.</p>

<p>The locust, in form, nearly resembles
the grasshopper; it hops and flies in the
same manner, but is more robust, and
has four large wings. The body is
scaly, the head large, and the eyes very
bright. Their legs and thighs are so
powerful, that they can leap to a height
of two hundred times the length of their
bodies; when so raised, they spread
their wings, and fly so close together,
as to appear like one compact, moving
mass. In most parts of the east, they
are made an article of food; and in
Egypt, the catching and cooking of
locusts forms a regular employment.
Their taste is said to be insipid.</p>

<h3 class="h3head"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick and Father Matthew.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">S<span class="sc">t. Patrick</span> was a famous missionary,
who went to Ireland about fourteen
hundred years ago, and taught the
people Christianity. At that time,
the Irish were heathen, and their religion
was a kind of idolatry. Their
priests were called druids, who taught
the adoration of the sun and moon,
together with many superstitions. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Patrick persuaded the people to dismiss
their errors and to adopt the truths of
Christianity. He accomplished this great
object by the gentle arts of persuasion;
and consequently his memory has been
ever held in kind and honored remembrance
by the greater part of the Irish
people. As it is a great while since <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Patrick lived, many curious stories have
been invented about him; and, among
others, it is related that he drove all the
venomous serpents, together with the
toads, frogs, lizards and tadpoles, out of
the island. Now this is no doubt a fiction.
Probably these stories are a kind
of allegory, by which, under the idea of
reptiles, the errors of heathenism are
meant, and these were cast out by the
good old saint.</p>

<p>But, however this may be, something
quite as wonderful as the tales about
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick, has taken place in our day.
A good priest or minister, called Father
Matthew, seeing that the people of Ireland
were very much addicted to drunkenness,
thought he would try to induce
them to give it up, and become temperate.
So he drew up a pledge, and began
to get the people to sign it. He
succeeded very well indeed; the people
signed the pledge, and many that were
very miserable before, on account of the
use of whiskey and other strong drinks,
were reformed, and became sober, useful,
and happy people. Seeing the great
good that was thus done, other persons
signed the pledge; and thus the great
work proceeded, until five or six millions
of people had signed it.</p>

<p>This is indeed a great and wonderful
work. It is impossible to say how much
evil has been prevented, and how much
good has been done by Father Matthew.
He has recently been to England, and
thousands signed the pledge there. It
is said he is coming to America, and
surely we shall all be glad to see him.
The following lines, about <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick
and Father Matthew, may be amusing
to our readers, and make them remember
the good they have done.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Combat between a Falcon and
Serpent.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">M. <span class="sc">De Vaillant</span>, a famous French
traveller, gives an account of a remarkable
engagement, of which he
was a witness, between a falcon
and a snake. The falcon is the chief
enemy of the serpent in all the countries
which it inhabits, and the mode in
which it wages war with it is very peculiar.
When the falcon approaches a
serpent, it always carries the point of
one of its wings forward, in order to
parry off its venomous bites. Sometimes
it finds an opportunity of spurning
and treading upon its antagonist, or
else of taking him upon its pinions, and
throwing him into the air. When, by
this system, it has, at length, wearied
out its adversary, and rendered him almost
senseless, it kills and swallows him
at leisure.</p>

<p>On the occasion which Vaillant mentions,
the battle was obstinate, and conducted
with equal address on both sides.
The serpent, feeling at last his inferiority,
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pageno">55</span>
endeavored to regain his hole;
while the bird, apparently guessing his
design, stopped him on a sudden, and
cut off his retreat, by placing herself before
him at a single leap.</p>

<p>On whatever side the reptile endeavored
to make his escape, the enemy
still appeared before him. Rendered
desperate, the serpent resolved on a last
effort. He erected himself boldly, to
intimidate the bird, and, hissing dreadfully,
displayed his menacing throat, inflamed
eyes, and a head swollen with
rage and venom. The falcon seemed
intimidated for a moment, but soon returned
to the charge; and, covering her
body with one of her wings as a buckler,
she struck her enemy with the bony protuberance
of the other. M. Vaillant saw
the serpent at last stagger and fall. The
conqueror then fell upon him to despatch
him, and with one stroke of her beak
laid open his skull.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Papyrus.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">I<span class="sc">n</span> a former number of the Museum
we gave some account of the <em>Papyrus</em>,
a kind of three-cornered reed
which grows in Egypt, and from the
pith of which the ancients made thin
paper. We give a cut representing some
of these reeds growing in the edge of the
water. They are still to be found in the
environs of Damietta, and on the banks
of Lake Menzaleh, and nowhere else in
Egypt. Perhaps the reason of this is,
that, formerly, the government, in order
to have a monopoly of the making of
paper, caused it to be pulled up and
eradicated in many parts of Egypt, and
only allowed it to grow where its preparation
could be superintended.</p>

<p>It is said that the mode of making the
paper was this: the epidermis or skin of
the stalk was carefully taken off, and
then the spongy pith within was cut into
very thin slices; these were steeped in
the water of the Nile, and several layers
were alternately placed crosswise, one
upon the other. These were then
pressed and dried, and rubbed smooth
with a piece of ivory. Thus a substance
was formed resembling our paper. It
was very tough and durable, and many
manuscripts upon it are still in existence,
which are two thousand years old. It
is said that the papyrus was used for
the making of paper so late as the ninth
century.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="center"><cite>The people of Greenland&mdash;&#8203;Labrador.</cite></p>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">I<span class="sc">n</span> order to observe some method, in our
account of the people of America, we
shall introduce our readers in the
first place to the Greenlanders, for I
shall here consider Greenland as belonging
to the American continent. For a
long time Greenland was supposed to be
united to this American continent; but
it is now ascertained to be a large
island. It lies so near to America, however,
on the north-east, that it is proper
to speak of it in this connection.</p>

<p>Greenland is a cold country, and very
mountainous. It is quite barren, except
in spots; but the sea is well stored with
fish. The country also abounds with
reindeer, foxes, white bears, sea-wolves,
sea-dogs and sea-cows.</p>

<p>The Greenlanders are short in stature,
seldom exceeding five feet in height;
but well formed, and rather stout. Their
faces are broad and flat; their eyes,
nose, and mouth commonly small; their
under lip sometimes thicker than the
upper; they have high breasts and
broad shoulders; their complexion is
brown or olive, and their hair coal-black
and long.</p>

<p>When they rise in the morning, they
appear thoughtful and dejected, but in
the evening, when their toil is over, they
are cheerful and happy. In general,
however, they are not very lively in
their temper, yet good-humored and
friendly. When a person dies, they
think he goes to the land of spirits
where he spends his time in hunting.</p>

<p><span class="pageno">57</span>
They are very fond of hunting and
fishing; and in both they are very
expert. They kill many seals; these
furnish them with food. The oil they
use as sauce, and of the blood they make
soup. They use the oil also for lamp
light and kitchen fire.</p>

<p>The clothing of the Greenlanders is
composed of the skin of the reindeer,
seals, and some kinds of birds, which
they sew together with the sinews of the
reindeer, seal, or whale. Their best
garments they keep quite neat; but
their ordinary dress abounds in filth and
vermin. Their clothes smell so strong,
that an inhabitant of the United States
would be glad to get to the windward of
a Greenlander.</p>

<p>The dwellings of the Greenlanders
are of two sorts; one for summer, the
other for winter. Their summer habitations
are light tents, constructed with a
few poles, covered with seal skins. Their
winter habitations are built of stones,
filled in with moss and covered with
turf. The principal apartment is chiefly
under ground, and the passage to it is so
low, that it is necessary to creep rather
than walk to it.</p>

<p>The Greenland women are very much
degraded, and their lives are toilsome.
They act as butchers and cooks; they
dress all the skins, and then make them
into garments, boots, shoes, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> They
are even obliged to build and repair the
winter habitations, excepting that the
men assist about the carpenter’s work.</p>

<p>We are sure that our readers would
not wish to live in Greenland; yet the
inhabitants of that island think their
country the best in the world. If at any
time a Greenlander is carried to a warmer
clime, he longs for his native snows;
and, if he cannot hope to return, he
sometimes pines away and dies.</p>

<p>Crossing Davis’ Strait, which is not
very wide, we reach that part of the
American continent which is called
Labrador. This is the country of the
Esquimaux.</p>

<p>These people resemble the Greenlanders
in several important respects.
Like them, they are low in stature, and
in complexion are very sallow. Their
beards are thick and bushy; but, unlike
the Greenlanders, their constitutions are
feeble. They are a timorous people,
and stroke their breasts in token of
peace, when they approach a stranger.</p>

<p>The word Esquimaux, signifies “eaters
of raw flesh.” They are very properly
named. They are a rude and miserable
race of beings, but some of them, it is
said, have been taught to read the Scriptures.
Their food consists chiefly of
fish, with the flesh of the seal and the
reindeer. Their greatest luxury is seal
blubber, or oil, which they devour with
as great relish as boys and girls of this
country do sweetmeats.</p>

<p>The dress of these people is made of
skins. Men and women dress nearly
alike. The women use no trinkets
except beads; but they ornament themselves
by drawing a needle and thread,
blackened with soot, under the skin.
This leaves a light blue mark. It is a
painful operation; but they delight so
much in this kind of marks, that they
sometimes cover almost their whole
body with them.</p>

<p>The Esquimaux have a singular kind
of dog, of which they keep large numbers.
In this country, we should think
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pageno">58</span>
it strange if a dog could not bark; yet
theirs never bark. They make use of
them to draw their sledges and guard
their habitations. Sometimes they eat
them, and use their skins for clothing.</p>

<p>Their dwellings in winter resemble
caves or holes dug in the earth. They
are rendered very filthy by the large
quantities of fat or oil which are burnt
in them, and which are used in cooking.
In summer, they live in tents, much like
the Greenlanders.</p>

<p>When Captain Parry made his voyage
towards the north pole, a few years
since, he found some Esquimaux people
living north of Hudson’s Bay. These
lived in huts, built of frozen snow.
They were very talkative, good-humored
and friendly. When they saw anything
that pleased them, some fell to singing
and dancing, while others screamed as
loud as they could. Captain Parry’s
men gave them some food; but they
made up hideous mouths at it, till, at
length, a sailor wet up some dried bread
pounded fine, with train-oil, which they
licked up with great delight. This
would be a loathsome dish to some of
our readers in the United States.</p>

<p>These people seem to have no idea of
formal religious worship, yet they believe
they shall live after death; and if they
are good, according to their ideas, that
they shall go to heaven and be perfectly
happy. Perfect happiness, in their view,
no doubt, consists in having plenty of
blubber to eat. Without the light of the
Bible, how degraded mankind are!</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Bonaparte and the Leg of Mutton.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">S<span class="sc">ome</span> forty years ago, we are told that in
England, such was the horror generally
entertained of Bonaparte, that he
was not only the fear of statesmen,
but the bug-bear of the nursery and the
schoolroom. “If you do this,” said the
schoolma’m, birch in hand, “I’ll send
Bony after you;” and, “if you don’t do
that, I’ll do the same thing.” Bony
was, in fact, the great scare-crow,&mdash;&#8203;and
many a child grew up under the impression
that he was a sort of secondary
evil spirit.</p>

<p>We are told by an English writer,
that, at a certain boarding school, upon
one occasion, a leg of mutton was stolen,
and, as almost every evil thing was laid
to Bonaparte, the children immediately
supposed that he must be the thief!
The writer himself, then a child, fancied
the emperor, with the mutton in his fist,
running off with it, and taking enormous
strides in his eagerness to escape.</p>

<p>How many lasting prejudices, how
many abiding errors are fixed in the
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="pageno">59</span>
mind by the inconsiderate threats of
those who have the charge of youth!
It is probable that many of the various
defects, weaknesses and eccentricities of
character,&mdash;&#8203;those is some cases which
are fatal to success in life,&mdash;&#8203;are caused
by the foolish and false modes of government
to which we allude. We hardly
know of a more unpardonable offence
than for a person to endeavor to govern
a child through fear of some fictitious
evil.</p>

<span class="place">Europe</span> signifies a country of
white complexions, so named, because
the inhabitants there were of a fairer

<h3 class="h3head">Snuff-Taking.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">S<span class="sc">nuff</span>-taking is an old custom; yet, if
we came suddenly upon it in a foreign
country, it would make us split
our sides with laughter. A grave
gentleman takes a little casket out of his
pocket, puts a finger and thumb in,
brings away a pinch of a sort of powder,
and then, with the most serious air possible,
as if he were doing one of the most
important acts of his life&mdash;&#8203;for, even with
the most indifferent snuff-taker, there is
a certain look of importance&mdash;&#8203;proceeds
to thrust it into his nose; after which he
shakes his head, or his waiscoat, or his
nose itself, or all three, in the style of a
man who has done his duty and satisfied
the most serious claims of his well
being.</p>

<p><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pageno">60</span>
It is curious to see the various ways
in which people take snuff. Some do it
by little fits and starts, and get over the
thing quickly. There are epigrammatic
snuff-takers, who come to the point as
fast as possible, and to whom the pungency
is everything. They generally
use a sharp and severe snuff, a sort of
essence of pins’ points. Others are all
urbanity and polished demeanor; they
value the style, as well as the sensation,
and offer the box around them as much
out of dignity as benevolence.</p>

<p>Some people take snuff irritably, others
bashfully, others in a manner as dry
as the snuff itself; generally with an
economy of the vegetable; others with
a luxuriance of gesture, and a lavishness
of supply that announces a more moist
article, and sheds its superfluous honors
upon neckcloth and coat. Dr. Johnson
was probably a snuff-taker of this kind.
He used to take it out of his <a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>waistcoat
pocket, instead of a box.</p>

<p>There is a species of long-armed
snuff-takers who perform the operation
in a style of potent and elaborate preparation,
ending with a sudden activity.
He puts his head on one side, then
stretches forth his arm with pinch in
hand, then brings round his arm as a
snuff-taking elephant might his trunk,
and finally shakes snuff, head and nose
together, in a sudden vehemence of convulsion.
His eyebrows are all the time
lifted up, as if to make more room for
the onset, and when he has ended, he
draws himself up to the perpendicular,
and generally proclaims the victory he
has won over the insipidity of the previous
moment, by a snuff and a great
“Flah!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="h3head">Squirrels.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">I<span class="sc">n</span> the second volume of the Museum,
we told some things about squirrels in
general, but did not say anything
about the different kinds particularly,
which we will now proceed to do. They
are so interesting a class (or, as the naturalists
would say, genus) of animals,
and especially so to children and young
persons, that we think the readers of
Merry’s Museum will like to hear more
about them.</p>

<p>They have often, I have no doubt,
been delighted at seeing their gambols,
and their activity in leaping from tree
to tree, and especially in seeing them
eat nuts, sitting on their hinder legs, or
haunches, with their bushy tails turned
up over their bodies, and holding the
nuts in their fore-paws, and making a
hole through the shell with their sharp
teeth to extract the kernel. It is very
amusing to observe them thus engaged,
and very surprising to see how rapidly
they will make a hole through the
hardest shelled nut. For this purpose,
without doubt, it is, that He who made
the squirrels, and who is the same glorious
Being that created us, has formed
their teeth very strong and very sharp.</p>

<p>There is quite a variety of squirrels
that inhabit this country, but the most
common in New England are the Gray
Squirrel, the Red Squirrel, the Ground
or Chip Squirrel, and the Flying Squirrel.
All these kinds are frequently to
be seen in almost every district, though
the flying squirrel, on account of his
habit of stirring about in the night, and
lying still in the day-time, is not so
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pageno">61</span>
frequently seen. They are all very
beautiful and interesting creatures.</p>

<p>The gray squirrel is the largest of
those I have named, and is frequently
hunted for food, as his flesh is very
palatable. A squirrel-hunt, in the fall,
is a very common and very exciting
amusement in many places in the country,
and, when conducted with as much
regard to humanity as practicable, is,
perhaps, not only a pleasant, but a
harmless and proper recreation. It is
very apt, however, to be attended with
the wanton slaughter of small birds,
and other instances of unnecessary cruelty.
In the newly-settled parts of the
country, these squirrels are sometimes
so numerous, that they make very serious
havoc with the corn crop, and, in
some cases, almost entirely destroy it.
Its ordinary food, however, consists of
nuts of various kinds, of which, like
the other squirrels, it lays up a large
supply for the winter. “This species,”
says Godman, in his American Natural
History, “is remarkable among all our
squirrels for its beauty and activity.
It is, in captivity, remarkably playful
and mischievous, and is more frequently
kept as a pet than any other.” I dare
say many of my young readers have
seen one or more of them in a rolling
cage, and, by rapidly running over the
bars, making it revolve almost with the
speed of a mill-stone. Its general color
is gray, as its name indicates, and it has
a very large, bushy tail, which sometimes
hides almost its whole body.</p>

<p>The red squirrel, or Chickaree, as
he is sometimes called in the Middle
States, is the next largest of the four,
and is a common and beautiful animal,
often seen on the trees by the road-sides.
Frequently, you will hear a half barking
and half twittering noise, and, looking
up, you will see a red squirrel on the
limb of a tree, a few feet above you,
from which the sound proceeds. It
seems to be a complaint for your encroachment
on his premises, and a kind
of warning to move out of his neighborhood.
They frequently come around
our dwellings for fruit and various sorts
of food. Several of them now reside
close by my house, and daily come into
my woodshed for butternuts, which my
children place there for them, and carry
them up into a pear-tree standing by
the side of the shed, and then devour
them. I caught one of them in a box-trap,
and kept him in confinement long
enough to make a picture of him, and
then set him at liberty, and he returns
as freely as ever. Their food and habits
generally are similar to those of the
gray squirrel, though they are much
more familiar, in the wild state, than
the other. He is of a reddish brown
color,&mdash;&#8203;whence he takes his name,&mdash;&#8203;and
he has a dark stripe along his side,
separating the red color from the white.</p>

<p>The account of the chip, or ground
squirrel, and the flying squirrel, will
be given in another number of the
Museum.</p>

of mildness of disposition and sociability
of manners. An accident in the
woods first put me in possession of this
bird, when in full plumage, and in high
health and spirits. I carried him home
with me, and put him into a cage already
occupied by a gold-winged woodpecker,
where he was saluted with such
rudeness, and received such a drubbing
from the lord of the manor, for entering
his premises, that, to save his life, I was
obliged to take him out again.</p>

<p>“I then put him into another cage,
where the only tenant was a female orchard
oriole. She also put on airs of
alarm, as if she considered herself endangered
and insulted by the intrusion.
The jay, meanwhile, sat mute and motionless
on the bottom of the cage, either
dubious of his own situation, or willing
to allow time for the fears of his neighbor
to subside. Accordingly, in a few
minutes, after displaying various threatening
gestures, she began to make her
approach, but with great circumspection
and readiness for retreat.</p>

<p>Seeing the jay, however, begin to pick
up some crumbs of broken chestnuts, in
a humble and peaceable way, she also descended,
and began to do the same; but,
at the slightest motion of her new guest,
wheeled round and put herself on the
defensive. All this ceremonious jealousy
vanished before evening, and they
now roost together, and feed and play
together in perfect harmony and good
humor. When the jay goes to drink,
his messmate very impudently jumps
into the water to wash herself, throwing
the water in showers over her companion,
who bears it all patiently, and venturing
to take a sip now and then between
the splashes, without betraying
the smallest token of irritation. On the
contrary, he seems to take pleasure in
his little fellow-prisoner, allowing her to
clean his claws from the minute fragments
of chestnuts which happen to adhere
to them.”</p>

<span class="sc">The Shoe-black and his Dog.</span>&mdash;An
English officer of the 44th regiment, who
had occasion, when in Paris, to pass one
of the bridges across the Seine, had his
boots, which had been previously well
polished, dirtied by a poodle dog rubbing
against them. He, in consequence, went
to a man, who was stationed on the
bridge, and had them cleaned. The
same circumstance having occurred more
than once, his curiosity was excited,
and he watched the dog. He saw him
roll himself in the mud of the river, and
then watch for a person with well-polished
boots, against which he continued
to rub himself.</p>

<p>Finding that the shoe-black was the
owner of the dog, he taxed him with the
artifice; and, after a little hesitation, he
confessed that he had taught the dog the
trick, in order to procure customers for
himself. The officer being much struck
with the dog’s sagacity, purchased him
at a high price, and took him to England.
He kept him tied up in London
some time, and then released him. He
remained with him a day or two, and
then made his escape. A fortnight afterwards,
he was found with his former
master, pursuing his old trade on the
bridge in Paris.</p>

<p class="p2 center">CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="center"><cite>Adventures in South America.</cite></p>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">B<span class="sc">eing</span> now about seventeen years old,
and having the reputation of being a
pretty good sailor, I was offered a
berth on board a vessel that was
going to Surinam, a Dutch settlement in
South America. This I accepted, not
only because the pay was liberal, but I
had a vague notion that I might there
hear something of my uncle Ben; for
we had always understood that when he
left <abbr title="Santo">St.</abbr> Domingo he sailed for that place.
My mother seemed always to have a
kind of faith that he was alive, and she
hoped I might hear of him at Surinam.
We set sail in November, our vessel
being a brig called the Sheldrake. We
proceeded for some time on our voyage
without any remarkable occurrence.</p>

<p>When we began to approach the
coast of South America, I could not but
be struck with the splendor of the stars
at night. In those southern latitudes,
we see a different set of stars from those
which are visible in New England, and
many of the groups are exceedingly
brilliant. The beauty of a tropical
night, especially at sea, even when the
moon is not visible, can scarcely be conceived.
The waves of the ocean are
flashing with phosphoric light, and to
such a degree, as to throw a lustre upon
the sides of the ship. The stars are of
sufficient brilliancy to light up the
atmosphere, giving to all the objects,
above and around, an aspect of peculiar
loveliness.</p>

<p>Surinam is a part of a great country
called Guiana, which forms the northeastern
corner of the South American
continent, and belongs a part to England,
a part to France, and Surinam to Holland.
It is a low, level region, presenting
not a single hill or highland for two
or three hundred miles. When we
approached the coast, I saw the land;
nothing was presented to the view but a
line of trees edging the shore, as far as
the eye could reach. Not a house was
visible, nor, indeed, any other object
which could give us the least intimation
as to what part of the coast we had
reached. We kept off the shore, and
proceeded south-eastward, keeping the
land in view.</p>

<p>As we were proceeding in this manner,
a smart gale sprung up one night,
and, in spite of our efforts to keep off, we
were driven in toward the land. In the
morning we struck the bottom, and soon
found that we were stuck fast in the
mud-bank which extends out three or
four miles to sea, along the whole coast
of Guiana. It was now December, a
time when the whole face of nature is
wrapped in snow in New England; but
where we were, the heat was excessive.</p>

<p>After about two days, we contrived to
work our brig out of the mud, and once
more proceeded on our course. At last
we saw a house upon the land, and the
captain, coming to an anchor, sent a boat
<span class="pageno">67</span>
ashore, to inquire whereabouts we were.
The answer was that we were near the
mouth of the river Courantin, about a
hundred miles west of Paramaribo, to
which place we were bound. This was
very agreeable news. We now proceeded
cheerfully on our way, and in the
course of two days we could perceive,
by the appearance of the water, that we
were near the mouth of a large river.
This we knew to be the Surinam, and
now, pursuing a southerly course, soon
found ourselves at the wharf of Paramaribo.</p>

<p>I had been a great deal around the
world and seen a great many beautiful
places, but never was I more delighted
than when I walked about this little city.
It is not larger than Providence, having
only twenty thousand inhabitants, but
the streets are long, straight and broad,
and are lined with the most beautiful
trees that can be imagined. These are
of various kinds, such as oranges, lemons,
shaddocks, tamarinds, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> At all
seasons of the year, these are bending
with fruit, and yet covered with blossoms.
The air is at all times filled with
perfume, especially at night.</p>

<p>The inhabitants are generally Dutch.
The houses are for the most part of wood,
but they are of a curious fashion, having
very heavy cornices, with abundance of
queer ornaments. Nothing can present
a stronger contrast than do the people in
these streets to those of New England.
In the latter place, there is great uniformity;
in the former, all is variety.
Here you may see the old Dutch planters,
with their huge trowsers and broad-brimmed
hats; sailors from all countries;
soldiers, Jews, Indians and Negroes.
The dresses of these people strike a
Yankee as being exceedingly droll, and
at first, I could not help laughing at
almost everybody I met. By degrees,
the singularity of things around me
wore off, and I became accustomed to the
manners of the place. The river before
the town of Paramaribo is at least a mile
in width, and as there are a great many
boats and barges constantly plying upon
its surface, the scene it presents is of a
very lively character.</p>

<p>The soil of Guiana is among the
richest in the world. The land lies so
low that it is necessary to build dikes,
for the purpose of keeping out the sea
and the inundations of the rivers. The
chief productions are coffee, sugar, cacao,
cotton and indigo. It also produces
ginger, pepper, cloves, nutmegs, castor
oil, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> The object of our voyage was
to obtain coffee and spices. There is
no country in the world more rich in its
fruits. Yams, sweet potatoes, bananas,
and the cocoa nut, are produced in abundance.
Oranges, lemons, limes, figs,
shaddocks, melons of many kinds, and
other delicious fruits, abound.</p>

<p>Nothing can equal the luxuriance of
the flowering shrubs and plants. Many
of these are of gigantic stature. The
trees often grow to a great height, and
thousands of bright-winged birds seem
to live a life of perpetual bliss amid the
perfume that is shed from their perennial
blossoms.</p>

<p>As soon as I had become a little
acquainted with the town, I began to
make inquiry about my uncle. I could,
however, hear nothing of him, until, at
last, an old sailor told me that he remembered
him perfectly well; that he came
<span class="pageno">68</span>
from Port au Prince to Paramaribo more
than twenty years before, where he
remained only for a year or two. The
man could give me no farther information
about him. He told me, however,
that there was an Englishman residing
up in the country about a hundred miles,
who had some business with my uncle,
and he could tell me all about him. As
our vessel was likely to be detained
about a month, I got permission of the
captain to go and see this man, to whom
I was referred for information respecting
my uncle.</p>

<p>I set out on foot, and pursued my way
along the banks of the river Surinam.
The road was roughly paved with
stones, and heavy wagons were frequently
passing to and fro upon it.
Although I was in a strange country, I
felt no concern, for I was naturally of a
fearless disposition, and beside, I was
armed with a cudgel in my hand, and a
pistol under my belt. So far, indeed,
was I from fear, that I felt a sort of
pleasant excitement in my present adventure.
The strange appearance of everything
around me rather excited than
saddened my mind. The trees, the
shrubs, the very birds, the whole aspect
of nature, the forms of the houses that I
occasionally met, the dress of the inhabitants,
all reminded me that I was far from
my own country, that I was a stranger
in a strange land; but still I was light of
heart, and whistling Yankee Doodle, I
plodded bravely on.</p>

<p>I had set out before sunrise, and by
ten o’clock had travelled more than a
dozen miles. Finding myself weary, I
turned off the road, and seated myself on
the bank of the river, beneath the shade
of a large tree. Here I sat for some time,
listening to the incessant chatter of parrots
and macaws over my head, and
observing the humming birds that were
buzzing among the flowering shrubs.</p>

<p>At last, I fell asleep, as little dreaming
of danger as if I were taking a nap upon
a summer day upon the banks of the
Connecticut river. I slept soundly for
some time, but at last I began to dream
about a great many strange things. I
fancied that I was wandering in a distant
land&mdash;&#8203;that I finally came to a great
cavern, which I entered&mdash;&#8203;that I was
weary and laid myself down to repose&mdash;&#8203;that
a horrid monster stole upon me in
my helpless condition, and was about to
rend me in pieces; I dreamed that I
attempted to rise and escape, but that I
could not stir. Such at last was the
horror of my mind, that I screamed
aloud, and at the instant awoke from
my sleep.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i026.jpg"
 width="75%"
 alt="Alligator"
 />
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>What was my horror to discover that
my dream was almost a reality! At
the distance of about twenty feet I saw
an enormous alligator, with his jaws
already distended, ready to press me in
his fangs. He was slowly stealing upon
me, but as I moved, he rushed forward,
his enormous tail brandished in the air,
and his claws spread, as if ready to
grapple me. Quick as thought, I leaped
from the ground, and at a single bound
placed myself behind the trunk of the
tree beneath which I had been sleeping.
The monster perceived that he was
foiled in his main object; but unluckily
I had left my wallet, containing a loaf
of bread and some cold meat, upon the
ground where I had lain. The creature
picked this up in his mouth, and wheeling
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pageno">69</span>
heavily round, marched down the bank
and plunged into the water. At first, I
was quite satisfied to have escaped with
my life; but I soon began to lament the
loss of my dinner. It was in vain, however,
to repine, so I seized my cudgel,
and proceeded upon my journey.</p>

<p class="center"><cite>The Lottery Ticket, continued.</cite></p>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">he</span> reader will remember that Tom
Trudge had set off from his home in
the country, to go to New York and
see to the success of his lottery
ticket. He soon arrived at the great
city, and found, to his vexation, that the
drawing of the lottery was postponed
for a week beyond the appointed time.
It seemed to him hardly worth while to
return to his home, but what should he
do to get rid of this terrible week?
When we are looking forward with
impatience to a certain event, the time
that stands between us and the object of
desire, is considered a hateful enemy,
and we set about killing it as well as we
can. Some people are as anxious to kill
time, as if it were a lion or a grizzly
bear.</p>

<p>At the period we speak of, some thirty
or forty years ago, a common way of
killing time, or, in other words, of wasting
that most precious gift of Heaven,
was to go to a tap-room or tavern, and
drink flip, whiskey or grog, and indulge
in low and vulgar conversation. Such
things are considered very silly now,
but it was otherwise then. Tom could
think of no other way to spend his week
than to go to the Jefferson and Liberty
tavern, and indulge in the amusements
of the bar-room. So thither he went,
<span class="pageno">70</span>
and by keeping himself in a state verging
on intoxication, he continued to while
away the awful seven days.</p>

<p>At last the appointed hour came. A
firm conviction had taken possession of
Tom’s mind, that he was to draw the
prize of fifty thousand dollars. He did
not seem to consider that there were
twenty thousand tickets, and that his
chance of getting it was only one in
twenty thousand. To a deluded mind,
such an obstacle is nothing; one chance
in twenty thousand is just as good as
certainty. When the drawing took
place, the office was thronged with a
crowd of people, most of them wretched
in the extreme. There were old men,
tottering upon the verge of the grave;
there were haggard women, evidently
starving for want of the money they had
invested in the lottery; there were
young persons, of both sexes, apparently
sunk in vice and wasted with poverty;
there were the sick and emaciated,
mingled with the strong and the reckless.
All anticipated with hope and
expectation,&mdash;&#8203;and yet all, or nearly all,
were destined to go away with disappointment
and sickness of heart.</p>

<p>Tom got close to the revolving wheel,
and, with his ticket in his hand, watched
the numbers as they were declared.
Several times his heart beat violently, as
a number came out near his own. The
drawing continued for more than two
hours, and his hopes began to fly, as he
perceived that the prizes were nearly all
out. At last his own number, which
was 777, was announced, and immediately
after, it appeared that it had drawn
the prize of 50,000 dollars!!!</p>

<p>Tom Trudge was in general a pretty
stable-minded man, but for a moment
his eyes grew dim and his brain reeled.
A strange variety of images glided in
confusion before his fancy, among which,
his wife, with a <em>yaller</em> damask gown
and a fine fan, were conspicuous. Finding
it necessary to have air, he left the
crowd, and went into the street. For
some time he could hardly tell where or
what he was; but at last his faculties
rallied, and, coming fully to himself, he
began to consider what was to be done.</p>

<p>He made inquiries at the office, and
found that he could cash his prize at
once by paying 5000 dollars discount;&mdash;&#8203;this
he did, and immediately found himself
in the possession of the sum of
forty-five thousand dollars,&mdash;&#8203;an immense
sum in those days, especially for a pedlar,
who had seldom before had fifty
dollars in hand at a time. Though he
was anxious to go home and communicate
his good fortune to his wife, he did
not forget her injunction. He went
forthwith and purchased a magnificent
changeable silk dress, of yellow and
purple, upon which was a representation
of a bathing goddess in figures of gold.
He also purchased a fan, on one side of
which was a Venus, and on the other a
Cupid, and started for home. Stopping
at every tavern on the road, he drank
liberally, and by the time he reached his
cottage, his brain was not a little muddled.</p>

<p>When he entered the little dwelling,
his hair was dishevelled, and his eyes
staring,&mdash;&#8203;his whole aspect, indeed, was
wild and singular. He, however, rushed
up to his wife, exclaiming, “I have got
it! I have got it!” He then kissed
her over and over again; took up his
<span class="pageno">71</span>
children and nearly stifled them with his
obstreperous embraces; at the same time,
he shouted, danced and whirled round
like a bedlamite. “What is it ails you,
Tom? What in natur’ is the matter?
Are you drunk or mad?” said his
spouse. “I have got it,&mdash;&#8203;there, there!”
said Tom, hurling the bundle of silk at
his wife’s head. “There’s the yaller
damask, and the fine fan! And here’s
the fifty thousand dollars!” Saying
this, he took an enormous bundle of
bank bills from his pocket, and giving it
a whirl around his head, threw it across
the room, and scattered the precious bits
of paper over the floor. It is impossible
to depict the astonishment of Mrs.
Trudge, as she beheld the shower of
bank bills, of five, ten and even twenty
dollars each, now lying before her, as
abundant as the very chips around the
wood-pile.</p>

<p>For a moment the dame was bewildered,
and the idea crossed her mind
that it was only a dream. It was indeed
so much like one of those visions that
often cheat the mind in sleep, that she
stood still, rubbed her forehead and looked
puzzled for several seconds. But in a
few moments her husband, quite out of
his head, began to dance among the
scattered bills, and cutting his pigeon-wings
where they lay thickest, made
them fly in all directions. Several of
them were near the hearth, and, caught
by the draught, edged closer and closer to
the heap of coals, and at last bounded
under the forestick and were instantly
reduced to ashes. Others took a flying
leap up the throat of the chimney, and
circling round and round, disappeared
amidst the soot and coiling smoke.</p>

<p>These circumstances at last recalled
Mrs. Trudge to her senses. She had
by degrees unravelled the tangled skein
of events and made out the truth. She
saw that her husband had actually
drawn a great prize; that, obedient to her
command, he had bought the damask and
the fan, and that, between tippling and
delight, his wits had gone wool-gathering
for a season. She saw the necessity of
immediate exertion to save the bank
bills, now scattered like worthless rags
upon the floor, her bewitched husband
still rigadooning in their midst, and
grinding them beneath his feet, or
making them circle about upon the
eddies of air that his brisk motions
created. Like a hawk pouncing upon a
brood of chickens, she now stooped upon
the cash, and gathered it by handfuls
into her apron, which she held up by the
two corners. Seeing what she was
about, her addled lord came after her
and chased her round the room. But
Mrs. Trudge took good care to keep out
of his way, and soon succeeded in picking
up the greater part of the bills. At
last her husband, being completely exhausted,
fell upon the floor. His good
wife then dragged him to bed, and leaving
him there in a sound sleep, she
completed her work of securing the
money.</p>

<p>Trudge slept long and heavy, but at
last he awoke. He seemed sadly bewildered,
and put his hand to his forehead
in a manner which showed that he not
only had a pain in his head, but was
troubled in mind. At last he turned to
his wife, and demanded, “Where is the
money?”</p>

<p>“Money?” said his better half,&mdash;&#8203;“Money!
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pageno">72</span>
what man&mdash;&#8203;money! money,
indeed! I think I should like some
money myself. ’Tis a pretty business
indeed: you go away and leave your
tender wife and suffering children for
ten long days; you then come back
drunk as a fiddler, cut up all sorts of
cantraps about the house, almost murther
your family, and then, after you
have come to your senses, you ask, as
innocent as a cat licking cream, ‘where
is the money?’ Where <em>is</em> the money?
say I. Zounds, where is my yaller
damask and the French fan? Come,
speak, man! Or is it all a dream?
Didn’t you draw the big prize, after all?
Oh, Tom, Tom! I told you so; I told
you how it would be; I knew you had
thrown away your money, and here we
are, a poor innocent family, reduced to
ruin, poverty and starvation!!” Upon
this, the dame held her apron to her
eyes, and the tears, real tears, bright as
crystals, chased each other down her
rosy cheeks.</p>

<p>Poor Tom Trudge! There he sat on
the bedside, the very image of botheration.
For the life of him, he could not
tell whether he had really drawn the
prize, or only been visited by a bewildering
vision. At last, however, the
mists that had hung over his mind began
to clear away; the truth came more and
more distinct to his mind, and finally he
recollected the drawing of the lottery,
his obtaining the forty-five thousand
dollars, his buying the damask and the
fan&mdash;&#8203;his journey homeward, and the
meeting with his wife. Just as he had
fully brought to recollection the whole
affair, he looked up, and discovered a
half malicious smile shining through the
tears of his spouse. She now burst into
a hearty laugh, and brought forth the
bundle of bank notes, nicely done up,
and Tom Trudge and his wife were the
happiest couple in the universe.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Desman, or Russian Musk-Rat.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">his</span> creature resembles the common
musk-rat, and is found both in Russia
and Sweden. It is about the
size of the common hedgehog, the
body being eight or nine inches long.
Its coat is like that of the beaver, and is
composed of hair intermixed with soft,
clear and delicate fur. The color is
brown above, and silvery beneath. The
tail, which is seven inches long, is one
of the most extraordinary mechanical
instruments in the whole animal kingdom.
It is composed of three parts, each
of which has a motion peculiar to itself.</p>

<p><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pageno">75</span>
The Desman chooses the margin of
such places as are convenient for the
burrows which it digs under water.
These are sometimes seven yards in
length, and are used as hiding-places.
The water freezes over these entrances,
and numbers of the animals are suffocated
every winter. If there are any
cracks or fissures in the ice, they crowd
to them, eagerly thrusting their noses up
to get the air.</p>

<p>The Desman preys at the bottom of
the water, and dabbles with its nose in
the mud, in search of the small insects
which inhabit it. Its senses of touch
and smell are very acute; this is rendered
necessary from the fact that the
animals upon which it preys are silent
and invisible. Although nearly blind,
it is not a nocturnal animal, but sleeps
during the night, at which time it keeps
its nose constantly moving, in order, it is
supposed, to retain the organs in a
proper state for work. Water is indispensable
to its existence, and after having
remained in a small quantity for any
time, it is rendered very offensive from
a strong musky odor, from which it
derives its common name of musk-rat.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Inquisitive Jack.</h3>

<p class="p2 center">CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="center small"><cite>About the hen and her chickens.</cite></p>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">I<span class="sc">t</span> seems natural for mankind to love
<em>accumulation</em>. When a child has
got two or three pieces of money, he
wants more, and his desire of increasing
his stores, increases with his little
wealth. When a person gets together
a few minerals, his wish to form a cabinet
begins, and in proportion as his collection
enlarges, his eagerness for more
specimens is stimulated. This love of
increase, is what I call a love of <em>accumulation</em>,
or a love of <em>laying up</em>.</p>

<p>Nov it is all the same with knowledge.
A person who has only a few
ideas, is like the child who has only a
<span class="pageno">76</span>
few coppers; he is usually eager to
spend them and get rid of them. But
one who has stored his mind with many
ideas, is like a person who has commenced
a cabinet of minerals: he wishes
to increase his collection; he wishes to
get new specimens, and is delighted
with those which are rare and beautiful.</p>

<p>Now, our hero, Jack, was just in this
condition: he had begun his mental
cabinet of knowledge; he had learned a
good deal about insects; and he had
entered the gate of a new and beautiful
science&mdash;<span class="sc">Ornithology</span>&mdash;or the study of
birds. How little did he think that his
acquaintance with the wren family had
advanced him so far into the delightful
mysteries of science. Yet so it was.
He now began to notice other birds, such
as the blue-bird, which belongs only to
America; the sparrows and finches,
which build their nests in the hedges
and bushes, and sing so sweetly.</p>

<p>About this time his attention was very
strongly attracted by a hen and her
chickens. Jack had himself set the
hen; that is, he had put the eggs under
her, there being thirteen; for he was
told that an even number was unlucky,
and an uneven number lucky; a notion,
by the way, that is very common, but
utterly destitute of foundation. He was
told that the eggs would be hatched in
just three weeks, and so it proved.</p>

<p>It is a curious thing that the eggs of
hens should always be hatched in just
three weeks, and I must stop to tell you
a story about this. A man who pretended
to be good and religious, told one
of his neighbors that his hens always
hatched on Sunday, and he wondered
what the reason was. “I can tell you,”
said the neighbor; “it is because you set
them on Sunday!” Thus we see that
the improper conduct of the pretended
good man was exposed.</p>

<p>But to return to Jack. About the
time the hen was to hatch, he went
every day to see if the chickens had
come along. He could not help wondering
at the patience of the old hen, in
sitting night and day so faithfully upon
her eggs. He noticed that she went off
her nest but once a day; that she was
then in a great hurry to get a little food
and drink, and return to her duty, as if
she was afraid her eggs would suffer.
He observed that nothing could tempt
her from her charge; the other hens
were out in the fields, scratching the
earth, feasting on worms and insects,
and delighting in the spring time; but
the old hen, forsaking these pleasures,
remained upon her eggs. Though she
was wasted by hunger, thirst and fever,
nothing could induce her to betray her
trust. There she continued, obeying
that voice within, which we call instinct.</p>

<p>On the twenty-first day of the hen’s
sitting, Jack went early in the morning
to the nest, and his delight knew no
bounds, when he heard, on approaching
it, the chickens peeping under the old
biddy’s feathers. The good mother herself
seemed to be filled with a sort of
quiet ecstacy. When she heard the
gentle cries of her offspring she endeavored
to hush them to rest by a few low
notes, as much as to <span class="lock">say,&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center">“Hush, my dear&mdash;&#8203;lie still and slumber.”</p>

<p>All this day, the hen remained on her
nest, and Jack gave her a little Indian
meal mixed with water, to eat. The
<span class="pageno">77</span>
next day, twelve of the thirteen eggs
were hatched, and the old hen, with an
air of importance, and great caution, set
forth with her brood. It was interesting
indeed to witness the scene.</p>

<p>No sooner had the mother and her
flock issued from the shed in which the
hatching or incubation had taken place,
than she began to scratch away the
leaves and grass with all her might.
The chickens kept close to her side, and
though but a day old, seemed to know
perfectly well what it all meant. They
picked up the little seeds and insects
and swallowed them down, taking care
to avoid stones and dirt, and things that
are not fit for food. How could these
little creatures know so much? That is
a curious question, and I can only
answer, that God has made them so!</p>

<p>The old hen went on from place to
place, clucking all the time, and taking
the utmost pains to keep her brood
together, and under her own immediate
inspection. She made her legs fly
merrily among the leaves, and many a
bug and grub and worm did she discover
for her little ones. She would eat
nothing herself, but gave everything to
her chickens, except once in a while
she came across a beetle or other insect,
too big for her infant flock, and then
she swallowed it.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the industry,
energy and watchfulness of the old
biddy. For hours together, she continued
to scratch and dig for her young
ones, as if life depended upon it. And
all this time, it was delightful to see how
careful she was of her brood. Her head
was bobbing up and down every instant,
and her sharp eye was turned on every
side, to see if there was danger. Not a
bird flew over unmarked, and if it was
in any degree threatening in its appearance,
the whole flock was instantly
drawn to a place of safety. If a cat or
dog came near, they were sure to repent
it, and learn better manners for the
future.</p>

<p>When, at last, the young emigrants
had filled their little crops, and become
weary, the old hen gathered them under
her wings. There is nothing in all
nature more pleasing than a hen brooding
her chickens. The little creatures
themselves are marked with a singular
smoothness, beauty and look of innocence.
Those which are most weary
bury themselves deep in the plumage of
their mother’s breast, and here, cherished
by a genial warmth, embedded in
down, and every want and fear appeased,
they fall to sleep. Those which are not
yet so drowsy, peep out their heads from
their mother’s feathers, and look around;
or they linger outside and pick among
the gravel for food; or they nibble at
the old hen’s beak; or perchance they
smooth some bit of their delicate plumage
that is ruffled; or possibly climb up the
old hen’s back. The look of innocence,
peace and happiness displayed by the
chickens, and the mingled aspect of care
and content borne by Mistress Biddy,
afford a touching and delightful picture.
Who can witness it and not feel that the
God of love is the author of what we
call <em>nature</em>?</p>

<p>All these things were noted by Jack,
and after he had observed them a long
time, he went for his aunt. He found
her quite busy, but he could not be contented
till she left her work and went
<span class="pageno">78</span>
with him to see the hen and her chickens.
After looking at them a long time,
they went to the house, and some days
after the following conversation took
place:</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jack.</span> Pray tell me, aunt Betsey, why
the hen that has chickens always keeps
<em>clucking</em>?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Aunt Betsey.</span> So that the chickens
may always know where she is. The
chickens are continually running about,
and sometimes they go to a considerable
distance, but as the hen is always clucking,
they can at any time find her. But
for this they would inevitably get lost.
If the Creator had forgotten to teach
hens to cluck, and had neglected to
make any other adequate provision, a
brood of chickens could never have been
raised.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">J.</span> Well, why do the chickens always
keep peeping?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Aunt B.</span> So that the hen may know
where they are. You will observe that
if two or three chickens are wandering
together, away from the hen, their peeping
is usually faint and low; but if one
is straying alone, his tones are loud and
distinct. They seem to feel confidence
when several are together, but if one is
alone, he feels that it is necessary to
speak out. The clucking of the hen
may be considered as continually calling
to her scattered brood, “Here I am,
chicks&mdash;&#8203;here I am,” and the peeping of
the chickens may be considered as saying,
“Here I am, mother&mdash;&#8203;here am I.”
In this way, a communication is kept up
even while the brood is scattered over a
wide space, in search of food. Almost
all birds have natural cries, which answer
the same purposes with them, as the
clucking of the hens and the peeping of
the chickens with these.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">J.</span> Well, aunt Betsey, I observe that
the old hen seems to <em>talk</em> to her chickens.
If a wren or a sparrow, or any
other little harmless bird flies by, the old
hen says, “curr-r-r-r-r,” in a moderate
tone, as much as to say “look out,” and
so all the chicks just cast their eyes
around and seem to take no notice of
what has happened. But if a hawk
appear in the air, and near by, the
“curr-r-r-r-r” is uttered in a wilder key.
The old hen steps high, and seeks a
shelter, and the little chickens run to her
as if frightened out of their little wits.
Now, what I want to say is, how do the
chickens, only two or three days old,
know so much and understand so well
what their mother means and says?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Aunt B.</span> You might as well ask,
Jack, how the chickens know so much
as to pick up seeds and worms when
only a day old. The seeming knowledge
of these little creatures, which is
often so wonderful, is to be explained,
as we explain the skill of the bees in
building their cells, and the ants in constructing
their little cities in the earth&mdash;&#8203;by
instinct&mdash;&#8203;a power or knowledge implanted
by nature, or, in other words, by
God, the author of nature. He gives
those powers; and though we may see
their effects, he only can explain their
operation. But there is one thing in
your observations upon the chickens, to
which I wish to call your attention,
Jack. Did you ever know the old hen
to call to her chickens in danger, when
they neglected or disobeyed the call?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">J.</span> No, not that I remember.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Aunt B.</span> Let this, then, be a lesson
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><span class="pageno">79</span>
to you, my boy. The little birds are
taught obedience to their parents by God;
and they obey. So God has taught children
obedience, for he has said in the
solemn commandment, “Honor thy father
and thy mother;” and the apostle
adds, “Children, obey your parents in
the Lord, for this is right.” The hen,
the parent of the chickens, is their guardian;
she knows more than they do;
she is stronger, and sees farther, and is
wiser than they. It is best for the chickens,
therefore, that they should obey her.
Were they to neglect her counsel, they
would be devoured by prowling beasts
or birds of prey. The obedience, therefore,
that they are called upon to exercise,
is imposed for their good. And just so
it is with respect to children; their parents
have more experience, knowledge,
and wisdom than they have; they know
what is best for them. It is, therefore,
for the true happiness of children that
they should obey their parents.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">City of Ancient Babylon.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap negindent">A<span class="sc">mong</span> the most wonderful things handed
down to us by history, is the
account of the ancient city of Babylon,
which is so often mentioned in the
Bible, and the remains of which astonish
the traveller at the present day. The
most particular description we have of it
is furnished by the Greek historian,
Herodotus, who visited it about four
hundred and fifty years before Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pageno">80</span>
He says that it was situated in a great
plain, the river Euphrates running
through it from north to south.</p>

<p>Its form was square; each side measured
fifteen miles, and the whole circuit
sixty miles. It was surrounded with
walls, three hundred and fifty feet high
and eighty-seven feet thick. Upon these
walls were two hundred and fifty towers.
The entrance to the city was by one
hundred gates of brass. Without the
wall, there was a deep ditch around the
city, filled with water.</p>

<p>Upon the tops of the walls, there were
buildings on each side containing one
room each. Between these there was
space to drive a chariot with horses.
The walls were built of bricks cemented
together by bitumen. At every thirty
layers of bricks, there was a layer of
reeds to give the fabric strength. The
engraving at the head of this article is
intended to give some idea of the form
of this mighty city, as described by
Herodotus.</p>

<p>The streets in the city were straight,
the houses being four or five stories high.
The temple of Belus was of amazing
magnitude, being nearly as large as the
great pyramid of Gizeh. It was a regular
square, each side measuring six hundred
feet. It consisted of eight towers
one above another, and was of immense
height. Beside this, there was a magnificent
palace, and connected with it
were hanging gardens of great extent.</p>

<p>The history of Babylonia goes back to
a period of high antiquity. Its founders
were among the earliest nations that
have been formed upon the earth, and
they appear to have reached a certain
degree of science and civilization, nearly
two thousand years before Christ. Nimrod
is mentioned in the Bible as the
founder of this empire, of which Babylon
was the capital. Here the kings of Assyria
held their court, and displayed a magnificence,
the accounts of which strike
us with wonder. Here many of the arts
were carried to great perfection, particularly
the manufacture of cotton, linen and
silk.</p>

<p>Babylon reached its magnificence
through the efforts of several succeeding
sovereigns. But Semiramis, the wife
of Ninus, is said to have been its founder.
In the year 538 B. C. it was taken by
Cyrus, king of Persia, who made it his
winter residence. At this place, Alexander,
who had conquered Persia, died,
323 B. C.</p>

<p>The ruins of this wonderful city are
to be seen about forty-eight miles south
of the present city of Bagdat. Its prodigious
walls have entirely disappeared,
and it is not easy to trace even the outline
of this once mighty metropolis.
The remains consist of heaps of rubbish,
principally bricks. It does not appear
that the architecture of the Babylonians
had reached a high degree of refinement.
Its chief characteristic was colossal dimensions.
The remains of the temple
of Belus are still to be distinguished, and
consist of a heap of ruins about one hundred
and twenty feet in height. This
complete destruction of Babylon, and the
desolation which presides over the scene,
is regarded as a terrific fulfilment of the
prophetic denunciations uttered against
it by the prophets.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<h3 class="h3head">The Leopard.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">his</span> animal, a handsome, but fierce
member of the great family of cats, is
smaller than either the lion or the
tiger. Its skin is very beautiful, being
spotted with large ocellated black
spots on a light ground, which sometimes
approaches to a bright yellow color.
The leopard is remarkably lithe and
flexible in all its motions. It is a very
symmetrical animal, and as its expression
partakes as much of wildness as of
fierceness, it is among the handsomest
of its tribe. It preys upon small animals,
is frequently on the hunt, and probably
kills more creatures than do the tiger or
the lion. It is said to be found only in
the islands of the Oriental Archipelago,
and in the Eastern peninsula.</p>

<p>The leopard climbs trees with astonishing
rapidity, so that few animals are
safe from his ravages. Man alone seems
to be respected by him, but if pressed
hard in the pursuit by the hunter, it will
turn upon him, and much skill and
prowess is then necessary to guard
against the fury of his attacks.</p>

<p>Two men in Southern Africa fell in
with a leopard in a mountain ravine, and
immediately gave chase to him. The
animal at first endeavored to escape by
clambering up a precipice, but being
hotly pressed, and slightly wounded by
a musket ball, he turned upon his pursuers
with that frantic ferocity which he
frequently displays, and springing upon
the man who had fired upon him, tore
him from his horse to the ground, biting
him at the same time very severely on
the shoulder, and tearing his face and
arms with his claws. The other hunter,
seeing the danger of his comrade, sprung
from his horse, and attempted to shoot
the leopard through the head; but, whether
owing to trepidation, or the fear of
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pageno">82</span>
wounding his friend, or the sudden motions
of the animal, he unfortunately
missed his aim.</p>

<p>The leopard now, abandoning his prostrate
enemy, darted with redoubled fury
on this second antagonist, and before the
poor man could stab him with his hunting
knife, he struck him in the eyes with
his claws, and had torn the scalp over his
forehead. In this frightful condition,
the hunter grappled with the savage
beast, and, struggling for life, they both
rolled down a steep declivity. All this
passed so rapidly that the other man had
scarcely time to recover from the confusion
into which his feline foe had thrown
him, to seize his gun and rush forward
to aid his comrade, when he beheld them
rolling together down the steep bank, in
mortal combat.</p>

<p>In a few moments, he was at the bottom
with them, but too late to save the
life of his friend. The leopard had so
dreadfully torn the throat of the unfortunate
man that his death was inevitable&mdash;&#8203;and
he had only the satisfaction of completing
the destruction of the savage
beast, which was already exhausted by
the wounds given in his breast by the
desperate knife of the expiring huntsman.</p>

<p>In a captive state, the leopard is easily
domesticated. There was a pair of these
animals recently in the tower of London.
The female was very tame and gentle,
and would allow herself to be patted and
caressed by the keepers, while she purred
and licked their hands. She had one
curious peculiarity; she was very fond
of destroying parasols, umbrellas, muffs
and hats, which she frequently contrived
to lay hold of before the unwary spectator
could prevent it, and tore them to
pieces in an instant. While this creature
was in a playful mood, she bounded
about her cell with the quickness of
thought, touching the four sides of it
nearly at one and the same instant. So
rapid were her motions that she could
scarcely be followed by the eye; and she
would even skim about the ceiling of her
apartment with the same amazing rapidity&mdash;&#8203;evincing
great muscular powers
and wonderful pliability of form.</p>

<p class="center">REMINISCENCES OF A RAG.</p>

<p class="center smaller">(<cite>Continued.</cite>)</p>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">W<span class="sc">e</span> shall now proceed to tell what appeared
to be written on the mysterious
scroll handed forth by the
seeming ghost of the rag-bin.</p>

<p>“I remained for a long time in the
bale of cotton, shut out from the light of
heaven, and in a state of uncertainty as
to my condition or fate. At last I felt
the bale to be tumbled about, and finally
I conjectured that we were now on shipboard.
This proved to be correct; for
in about a month we were landed at Liverpool,
a great city on the western coast
of England. In a few weeks we were
taken by canal through a beautiful country,
<span class="pageno">83</span>
to Manchester, thirty-six miles east
of Liverpool.</p>

<p>“As we glided along, I could see that
the whole country was highly cultivated,
and almost covered with cities and villages.
Hundreds of tall steepling chimneys
rose from their places, and poured
forth volumes of smoke or flame, thus
showing that the people, on all hands,
were busy in their various manufactories.
Never did I imagine such scenes of
industry and activity.</p>

<p>“On arriving at Manchester, I was
amazed to see so great a city; it consisted,
in part, of many buildings four and
five stories high, some of them having a
hundred windows! It was night when
we arrived, and these buildings, which
were chiefly cotton factories, were all
lighted up. Never did I see such a display;
it seemed as if the whole city was
illuminated.</p>

<p>“Our bale was soon landed at one of
the factories, and we were stowed into a
ware-room, almost as big as a church.
Here were at least three hundred bales
of cotton, as big as ours. Thinks I to
myself, it will be a long time before it will
be our turn to be spun, and twisted, and
woven into cloth. In this, however, I
was mistaken, for, in about a month, I
found myself twitched out of the bale
and put into a machine, where I was
picked all to pieces. I was then put
into the carding machine, which made
me dance up and down and whirl about
and about with such velocity, and amid
such an everlasting hubbub, that I completely
lost my senses. When I came
to myself, I was made into a smooth
roll, about a yard long, and one end of
me was being twisted into thread. The
room where this took place, was as big
as a church, and several thousand spindles
were twirling about and twisting the
cotton into threads as fine as a hair. I
was fairly giddy with the operation, and
did not feel comfortable till I found myself
wound snug and smooth upon a little
spool or bobbin.</p>

<p>“I was not permitted to remain long
in this state, for I was shortly placed
upon a loom with a multitude of other
spools, and was soon woven into a piece
of fine muslin. I now went through
various operations, and was finally done
up with the piece, consisting of twenty-seven
yards. I was despatched in a car,
with forty-nine other pieces, to London,
and in about a month we were shipped
to Brazil, in South America. Our case
was then purchased by an American
merchant: this was bought by a shopkeeper
of Rio de Janeiro, who soon
opened it and took out the piece I was
in and laid it upon a shelf. In a day or
two I was bought by a beautiful lady,
and made into a frock for her infant.</p>

<p>“It was a gay time now, for I was
dandled up and down and made a great
deal of. Everybody said, what a beautiful
baby! and what a pretty frock! But
sorrow soon followed. The lovely infant
died; it was laid in its coffin, and I
was its burial dress! The corpse was
borne to the church with a long retinue
of priests, holding torches in their hands.
When they came to the church, they
sung a solemn dirge, and the dim arches
of the holy edifice seemed to echo back
the sad and wailing tones. The coffin
was deposited in its vault&mdash;&#8203;the music
ceased&mdash;&#8203;the throng dispersed, and a fearful
stillness reigned around. I could see
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pageno">84</span>
and feel, even amid the darkness of my
prison house, how sweet was the placid
face of that lovely babe&mdash;&#8203;smiling in its
lonely, desolate grave! I clung to its
bosom, and was happy, even though I
had no other hope than to perish, and
moulder, and be forgotten.</p>

<p>“A day passed, and midnight came.
A fearful stillness rested upon the church
and all around&mdash;&#8203;save that, perchance, the
wings of the bats might be heard, fanning
the dark recesses of the cathedral; or
the drops of moisture that fell upon the
lids of the coffins, at long intervals, from
the arches of the tombs, caught the listening
ear of silence. But at last the stillness
was disturbed; a light, sliding step
was heard upon the marble floor of the
church; the door of the tomb where I
lay was opened, the lid of the coffin was
lifted, and the rays of a dark lantern
were turned upon the corpse of the babe.
I could see that it was the sexton who
thus invaded the sanctuary of the dead.
He first took a diamond from the bosom
of the infant, and then, disrobing the
body, carried me away. I was borne to
his house, where his wife soon took the
frock to pieces, and the long skirt was
now but a simple piece of muslin. It
was carefully ironed and sold to a pawnbroker.</p>

<p>“I was soon purchased by a negro
girl, a slave, black and glittering as anthracite,
who carried me home and made
me into a wedding turban. Three days
after I had been sleeping as a shroud in
the crypt of the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas,
I was the head-dress of a bride, named
‘Phillipina Squash!’”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="h3head">The Pyramids of Egypt.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">hese</span> gigantic monuments, erected before
the period at which authentic
history begins, have ever excited the
curiosity and wonder of mankind.
Their vast antiquity, their amazing magnitude,
the mystery which hangs over
their origin and design, contribute to
render them objects of intense interest.</p>

<p>There are great numbers of these
structures in Egypt, and about eighty in
Nubia. Those of the former country
are all situated on the west side of the
Nile, and extend, in an irregular line,
to the distance of nearly seventy miles.
The most famous are those of Jizeh,
opposite the city of Cairo. The largest,
which is said to have been built by
Cheops, a king of Egypt, about 900 years
B. C., is by far the greatest structure in
stone that has been reared by the hand
of man. Near this great pyramid, are
two others, of considerable size, and several
smaller ones. All have square
foundations, and their sides face the
cardinal points. The largest pyramid
excited the wonder of Herodotus, who
visited Egypt 450 B. C. He says that
one hundred thousand men were employed
twenty years in building it, and
that the body of Cheops was placed in a
room beneath the bottom of the pyramid.
The second pyramid is said to have been
built by Cephrenes, the brother of Cheops,
and the third by Mycerines, the son
of Cheops.</p>

<p>The great pyramid consists of a series
of platforms, each of which is smaller
than the one on which it rests, and consequently
presents the appearance of
steps. Of these steps there are two hundred
<span class="pageno">85</span>
and three. They are of unequal
thickness, from two feet and eight inches,
to four feet and eight inches. The stones
are cut and fitted to each other with great
nicety. The whole height is four hundred
and fifty-six feet. The top is a
platform, thirty-two feet square. The
foundation is seven hundred and sixty-three
feet on each side, and covers a
space of about thirteen acres.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i031.jpg"
 width="65%"
 alt="Pyramids of Egypt"
 />
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The pyramid has been entered, and
has been found to consist of chambers
and passages, some of great extent.</p>

<p>The material of which the pyramids
are built is limestone, and it is probable
that this was obtained from limestone
quarries contiguous to the place where
they now stand. The stones of the
great pyramid rarely exceed nine feet in
length, six and a half in breadth, and
four feet eight inches in thickness.
The ascent is attended with great difficulty
and danger, on account of the
broken state of the steps; yet it is frequently
accomplished, and sometimes
by females. The scene from the top is
described by travellers as inconceivably
grand.</p>

<p>The purpose for which these monuments
were reared, has been a question
of great interest. It has been conjectured
that they were built as observatories, but
this seems to be an absurd supposition;
for why build three or four close together
of nearly the same elevation? There is
no good reason to doubt that they were
erected as burial places for the Egyptian
kings, who caused them to be constructed.
The natural pride of man, the desire of
being remembered for ages, and probably
some superstitious notions connected
with the religion of the country, doubtless
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pageno">86</span>
furnished the motives for the construction
of these vast monuments.
Nothing can better show the folly of
human ambition, than that, while these
senseless stones remain, their builders
have perished, and their memories been
blotted out forever.</p>

<p class="center"><cite>The Indians.</cite></p>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">I<span class="sc">n</span> a former number we have given some
account of the northern Indians, called
Esquimaux; and as our readers may
like to know how these people look,
we give a likeness of one of them. He
would hardly be thought a beauty among
us, but no doubt he would find some one
to fancy him among the girls of his tribe,
who live on fish and blubber oil.</p>

<p>All our readers know that when
America was discovered, it was inhabited
by tribes of copper-colored people, whom
we generally call <dfn>Indians</dfn>. These were
<span class="pageno">87</span>
divided into many tribes, and spoke many
different languages, but they bore a general
resemblance, which led to the conclusion
that this remarkable race came
originally from Asia, and had a near
affinity to the roving, warlike tribes
there, called Tartars.</p>

<p>The American Indians, at the time of
the discovery of Columbus, might be
viewed in four groups: 1st. The Mexicans,
who had built cities, established a
permanent government, carried on manufactures
and commerce, and cultivated
the earth with care and success; 2d. The
Peruvians, who had made nearly the
same advances in civilization as the
Mexicans, though differing in many of
their arts, manners, customs, and opinions;
3d. The Caribs, a warlike nation,
inhabiting the Caribbean isles and the
adjacent coast of South America; and,
4th. The various scattered tribes of the
continent.</p>

<p>We shall not enter into a minute
account of these several groups, for so
much has been said of the Indians, that
almost all persons are pretty well acquainted
with the subject. Among the
chief tribes of New England, when our
forefathers settled there, were the Pequots,
Narragansets and Mohegans. In
New York, are the Mohawks, Senecas,
Oneidas, Delawares and Ottoes. In the
south and west, there are many other
bands or nations.</p>

<p>These tribes, of which there were perhaps
several hundred in North America,
varied in number from two hundred to
five thousand inhabitants each. They
all lived chiefly by hunting and fishing,
raising a few pumpkins and melons, and
a little corn, to aid in obtaining a subsistence.
They knew not the use of iron
or other metals for cutting; they had no
domestic fowls or animals, except, perhaps,
dogs far to the north; they lived a
wandering life, having no better houses
than huts of wood and mud.</p>

<p>Their weapons of war were hatchets
of stone, bows and arrows; their fishhooks
were the bones of fishes. They
had no tables or chairs; no religious
edifices, and but few religious notions.
The men spent their time in hunting
and the chase, and the women performed
all the drudgery.</p>

<p>In war, these savages were cunning,
deceitful and cruel: they could track
their enemy through the forest by the
traces left upon the grass and leaves;
they would lurk in the thickets for days,
and then suddenly and unexpectedly
burst upon their victims. The warriors
taken in battle, were often tortured and
put to death&mdash;&#8203;but these disdained to show
the slightest emotion, even though knots
of pine were stuck in their flesh and set
on fire!</p>

<p>At first, these Indians received our
forefathers with kindness, but, exasperated
by various acts of injustice and cruelty,
they became treacherous and vindictive.
Many bloody encounters took place
between the settlers and the savages, in
all of which the latter suffered defeat and
loss, until they became extinct along the
Atlantic border, and the remains of their
tribes only continue to linger along our
western frontier.</p>

<p>The natives that dwelt in the West
Indies, some of which were very numerous,
have entirely disappeared. Mexico
was conquered by Cortez more than three
hundred years ago, and the whole Indian
<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pageno">88</span>
race, amounting to six or eight millions,
belonging to that nation, were subjugated.
The Indians of Mexico now acknowledge
the authority of the established government,
pay taxes, and generally belong to
the Catholic religion. They are still an
ignorant and half barbarous race.</p>

<p>The Peruvian nation, also amounting
to millions, was conquered by Pizarro
about the year 1535, and from that period
the natives became subject to the laws
of the white man. These, as in Mexico,
are partially civilized.</p>

<p>There are still many South American
tribes, which are independent, and maintain
their savage habits. The Araucanians,
a Chilian tribe, the noblest race
of aboriginal Americans, have never been
fairly subdued, and though partly civilized,
they maintain a lofty spirit of
independence. Far south, toward the
extremity of South America, the broad-shouldered
Patagonians live in savage
wildness, and around the rocky and tempestuous
shores of Cape Horn, the naked,
shivering Fuegians snatch from the raging
elements a precarious subsistence.</p>

<p>At the present day there are several
tribes inhabiting the vast regions that lie
west of the Mississippi, consisting, for the
most part, of fragments of tribes driven
by the white man from more eastern
settlements, to their present abodes.
Here they are still lords of the forest,
prairie, river and mountain, and here
they maintain their wild independence
and savage customs. They have become
in some degree changed by intercourse
with the white race; they have horses,
and fire-arms and blankets, and a few
utensils derived from civilized man; but
they are still hunters and warriors, are
still without books, or a settled government,
or fixed habitations, or extended
agriculture, or any of the leading features
of civilization. In another number we
propose to tell something about the Indians
as they now are.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">A Monster of the Deep.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">O<span class="sc">ur</span> readers know that in some parts
of the ocean there are enormous sea
animals called Sepia, which are a
kind of polypi. They have very
long legs, and are said sometimes to
seize upon the coral divers along the
coast of Italy. Mr. Beale tells us the
following adventure with a creature of
this sort.</p>

<p>“While upon the Bouin Islands,
searching for shells on the rocks, which
had just been left by the receding tide, I
was much astonished at seeing at my
feet a most extraordinary looking animal,
crawling towards the retreating
surf. I had never seen one like it
before. It was creeping on its eight
legs, which, from their soft and flexible
nature, bent considerably under the
weight of its body, so that it was lifted
by the efforts of its tentacula only a
small distance from the rocks.</p>

<p>“It appeared much alarmed on seeing
me, and made every effort to escape,
while I was not much in the humor to
endeavor to capture so ugly a customer,
whose appearance excited a feeling of
disgust, not unmixed with fear. I, however,
endeavored to prevent its career, by
pressing on one of its legs with my foot;
but, although I used considerable force
for that purpose, its strength was so great
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pageno">89</span>
that it several times quickly liberated its
member, in spite of all the efforts I could
employ in this way, on wet, slippery
rocks. I now laid hold of one of the
tentacles with my hand, and held it
firmly, so that the limb appeared as if it
would be torn asunder by our united
strength. I soon gave it a powerful
jerk, wishing to disengage it from the
rocks to which it clung so forcibly by its
suckers, which it effectually resisted;
but the moment after, the apparently
enraged animal lifted its head, with its
large eyes projecting from the middle of
its body, and, letting go its hold of the
rocks, suddenly sprang upon my arm,
which I had previously bared to my
shoulder for the purpose of thrusting it
into holes in the rocks to discover shells,
and clung, with its suckers, to it with
great power, endeavoring to get its beak,
which I could now see, between the
roots of its arms, in a position to bite.</p>

<p>“A sensation of horror pervaded my
whole frame, when I found this monstrous
animal&mdash;&#8203;for it was about four feet
long&mdash;&#8203;fixed so firmly on my arm. Its
cold, slimy grasp was extremely sickening,
and I immediately called aloud to
the captain, who was also searching for
shells at some distance, to come and
release me from my disgusting assailant.
He quickly arrived, and taking me down
to the boat, during which time I was
employed in keeping the beak away
from my hand, quickly released me by
destroying my tormentor with the boat
knife, when I disengaged it by portions
at a time. This animal was that species
of Sepia which is called by whalers
‘rock squid.’ Thus are these remarkable
creatures, from the different adaptation
of their tentacles and slight modifications
of their bodies, capable of sailing,
flying, swimming, and creeping on
the shore, while their senses, if we may
judge from the elaborate mechanism of
their organs, must possess corresponding
acuteness and perfection.”</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Sperm Whale.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">he</span> Sperm Whale is much less known
than the common whale, which is
usually taken by our whalers. The
following account of it, furnished by
Thomas Beale, is interesting.</p>

<p>“The sperm whale is a gregarious
animal, and the herds formed by it are
of two kinds&mdash;&#8203;the one consisting of
females, the other of young whales not
fully grown.</p>
<span class="pageno">90</span>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i033.jpg"
 width="90%"
 alt="Whales"
 />
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>“These herds are called by whalers,
‘schools,’ and occasionally consist of
great numbers; I have seen in one
school as many as five or six hundred.
With each herd or school of females,
are always from one to three large bulls,
the lords of the herd, or, as they are
called, the ‘school-masters.’ The full-grown
whales, or ‘large whales,’ almost
always go alone in search of food; and
when they are seen in company, they
are supposed to be making passages,
or migrating from one ‘feeding ground’
to another. The large whale is generally
very incautious, and if alone, he
is without difficulty attacked, and by
expert whalers generally very easily
killed; as frequently, after receiving the
first blow or plunge of the harpoon, he
appears hardly to feel it, but continues
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pageno">91</span>
lying like a ‘log of wood’ in the water,
before he rallies or makes any attempt
to escape from his enemies.</p>

<p>“Large whales are, however, sometimes,
but rarely, met with, remarkably
cunning and full of courage, when they
will commit dreadful havoc with their
jaws and tail; the jaw and head, however,
appear to be their principal offensive
weapons.</p>

<p>“The female breeds at all seasons, producing
but one at a time. The young
when first born are said to be fourteen
feet long. The females are much smaller
than the males. They are very remarkable
for their attachment to their young,
which they may be frequently seen
urging and assisting to escape from danger
with the most unceasing care and
fondness. They are also not less remarkable
for their strong feeling of
sociality, or attachment to one another;
and this is carried to so great an extent,
that when one female of a herd is
attacked or wounded, her faithful companions
will remain around her to the
last moment, or till they are wounded
themselves. This act of remaining by
a wounded companion, is called ‘heaving
to,’ and whole ‘schools’ have been
destroyed by dexterous management,
when several ships have been in company,
wholly from their possessing this
remarkable disposition. The attachment
appears to be reciprocal on the part
of the young whales, which have been
seen about the ship for hours after their
parents have been killed.</p>

<p>“The young whales, or ‘young bulls,’
go in large schools, but differ remarkably
from the females in disposition, inasmuch
as they make an immediate and
rapid retreat upon one of their number
being struck, who is left to take the
best care he can of himself. I never
but once saw them ‘heave to,’ and in
that case, it was only for a short time,
and seemed rather to arise from their confusion
than affection for their wounded
companion. They are also very cunning
and cautious, keeping at all times
a good look-out for danger. It is consequently
necessary for the whaler to be
extremely cautious in his mode of
approaching them, so as, if possible, to
escape being heard or seen, for they
have some mode of communication with
one another in an incredibly short space
of time; the distance between them
sometimes amounting to five, or even
seven miles. The mode by which this
is effected remains a curious secret.”</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Squirrels.</h3>

<p class="center smaller">[For Merry’s Museum.]</p>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">he</span> Chip Squirrel or Ground Squirrel
is the most common and familiar of
all the squirrels. “He is most commonly,”
says Godman, “seen scudding
along the lower rails of the common
or ‘Virginia’ fences, which afford
him at once a pleasant and secure path,
as, in a few turns, he finds a safe hiding
place behind the projecting angles, or
enters his burrow undiscovered. When
no fence is near, or his retreat is cut off,
after having been out in search of food,
he becomes exceedingly alarmed, and
runs up the nearest tree, uttering a very
shrill cry or whistle, indicative of his
distress; and it is in this situation that he
is most frequently made captive by his
persecuting enemies, the mischievous
school-boys.” I shall presently mention
a much better mode of treatment of them
by children, than the one here alluded
to, and which is far too common.</p>

<p>He is not only the most numerous, but
the most beautiful of all the squirrels I
have named. His general color (if it
is necessary to describe an animal so
well known) is a reddish brown, but he
has five black stripes running lengthwise
along his body, one in the middle of the
back, and two on each side, and between
the two on each side is a stripe of pure
white. These stripes, together with
white stripes on each side of his head,
above and below the eyes, give him a
very beautiful appearance, and it is no
wonder that children, who are commonly
pleased with what is beautiful in nature,
take a strong liking to him. He is
sometimes called the Striped Squirrel,
on account of his markings, but he is
more commonly called the Chip Squirrel,
or Chipmuck, from the chipping sound
he is accustomed to make, or the Ground
Squirrel, because he makes a burrow in
the ground for his lodging-place instead
of residing in a tree, as the other squirrels
do. Mr. Godman says he is sometimes
called Hacky; but why so called, I
am unable to tell. I have mentioned
his being a familiar animal; I will now
state a circumstance, to show how
familiar he may be made, and how far
<span class="pageno">93</span>
kind and gentle treatment operates to
deprive wild animals of their fears.
One, which had a hole not far from my
house, used frequently to come about
the house for food, which my children
observing, would throw walnuts or
hickory nuts to him. He soon became
so gentle he would take the walnuts
from their hands, and, after biting off the
sharp and jagged ends of the nuts, he
would stow them in his capacious cheeks
or pouches, sometimes taking from their
hands and stowing away in this manner
four hickory nuts, two in each pouch,
which he would carry off and deposit in
his hole, and then immediately return
for another cheekful.</p>

<p>The Flying Squirrel is the smallest of
all the squirrels in New England, and
in some respects the most interesting.
He is not as well known as the other
three kinds I have described, principally
on account of his nocturnal habits; that
is, he generally sleeps during the day,
and is in motion during the night.
He is not so beautiful in his colors and
markings as the chip squirrel. His
general color is a brownish ash or gray
on the upper part of the body, and white
underneath, with a yellowish margin
which unites with a dark stripe that
borders the gray color of the upper
parts. His form and attitudes are beautiful,
however; his hair very soft and
silky, and his eyes, which are black, are
large and prominent. But what makes
him the greatest object of curiosity, is,
that the skin on each side of his body is
dilated and attached to both his legs,
nearly or quite down to the claws, so
that when he extends his legs horizontally
it forms a kind of wings or parachute,
by which he is enabled to sail
obliquely through the air a considerable
distance. He cannot, however, rise, as
he never flaps his wings; but by taking
a leap from the top of a tree and spreading
his sails, he reaches the body of
another tree several rods distant, and
running to the top of the latter, he again
makes a similar flight, and in this way
passes rapidly through the forest. His
tail is flattened horizontally, and doubtless
answers the purpose of a rudder.</p>

<p>His food is similar to that of the other
squirrels, consisting of nuts, grain, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
They make their abode in hollow trees,
from which they will frequently run out,
when the tree is struck with an axe and
smartly jarred, to see what is the matter.</p>

<p>They frequently enter human dwellings.
Last winter I caught, in succession,
seven, in the upper chamber of
my house, and kept six of them shut up
till spring, when I carried them to the
woods near by and released them. They
also became pretty familiar, and would
eat and gambol in my presence and that
of my family in their box. In the
course of last summer, I again saw one
in my house, probably one of the same.
Three other instances have come to my
knowledge in which they were found in
dwelling-houses.</p>

<p>In the animals we have been considering,
we see an interesting specimen of
that wonderful variety and beauty which
constitute the charm of the great world
of life. The study and contemplation
of the works of God, animate and inanimate,
will be attended with continued
and increasing admiration, and if the
mind is properly attuned to the harmonies
that pervade them, it will be made
<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pageno">94</span>
better and better, and will be led, in the
words of the poet, “from nature up to
nature’s God.”</p>

I am not much of a poetess, I cannot put it in
the form of an acrostic or rhyme, and I hope a
plain answer will do. It is the first one I have
ever found out, but I think it is because I have
not had patience enough, for I found it very
easy. I am glad you are going to have some
good long stories, equal to the Siberian Sable-hunter,

<p class="p2 center">THE LITTLE SOLDIER.</p>

<p>We insert the following, with thanks to the
writer, and should be glad to receive the
remainder of the story:</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="sc">Mr. Merry</span>:</p>

<p class="blockquote">I am one of your “blue-eyed friends,” and
although not a “little” one, I have been much
interested in the articles which have appeared
in the Museum, connected with the war of our
Revolution.</p>

<p class="blockquote">I know many of the warm advocates for
<em>peace</em>, query how far it is judicious to interest
the minds of the rising generation, in the details
of <em>war</em>; still, I must believe that many of the
blessings we enjoy, peculiar to our own country,
were purchased by the self-sacrifices of
our fathers, and their “children’s children,”
should not overlook this fact.</p>

<p class="blockquote">It has occurred to me that a little sketch of
one who took an active part in the scenes of
those eventful days, may perhaps amuse your
readers. The old soldier from whom I have
my history, enlisted into the army at the age
of fifteen, as a fifer. He was much below the
common size of boys at that age, and, for this
reason, chose to be a musician. He heard the
sound of the guns on the morning of the Lexington
battle, and soon after this event, he was
ordered, with the company to which he belonged,
to New York. His good mother furnished him
with all that a kind, pious mother could think
of, for his comfort, even to a ball of yarn and a
needle, to repair his stockings. He returned
them to her, after his service in the army,
“<em>safe and sound</em>.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">Soon after their arrival in New York, the
alarm was given that the enemy were approaching;
and not doubting a skirmish, at least, a
company of men volunteered to go out and meet
the enemy. They were ordered to be in ambush,
and then rise suddenly upon the foe.
The little fifer (a mere boy) joined the party,
and soon found himself in the heat of battle.
He has often told me that he felt no sensation
of fear at the time; the dense smoke, the
roaring of the cannon, the groans and shrieks
of the dying, were alike unheeded by him.
His only wish was to load&mdash;&#8203;aim&mdash;&#8203;fire, and <em>kill</em>
one of the British. He always thought he
accomplished his object, and God seems to have
awarded a quick retribution.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Just as he had fired, his party were ordered
to retreat, and, in turning to obey the orders,
the poor fellow received a ball in the back,
which lodged near the spine. He thought it
must be his death-wound, and after moving on
a few rods, he left his comrades, and concealing
himself behind a small white oak tree, he set
up his gun, and falling on his knees, he committed
his soul to the Saviour. His eye-sight
and hearing left him; he was bleeding profusely,
and of course believed this to be his last
hour on earth.</p>

<p class="blockquote">How long he was in this state he could not
tell, but hoping his strength would permit, as
soon as he could see and hear, he crawled on
his hands and knees into the road, and soon
met the surgeon, who, with the vehicle for the
wounded soldiers, was on his way to the place
where the skirmish was fought. The hospital
was a mile distant, and the lad chose to
remain where he was, until the cart came back.
He was placed in it, and, in the course of a day
or two after his wound had been given, the surgeon
attempted to extract the ball, but it could
not be done without causing instant death.</p>

<p class="blockquote">He remained in the hospital eight or ten
weeks, slowly recovering his strength. He was
two hundred miles from home; poor, feeble,
and in this sad condition, he resolved to attempt
a journey home on foot. A young man, who
was his intimate friend and fellow-townsman,
agreed to be his guide and protector, and they
started on their melancholy journey.</p>

<p class="blockquote">If the sketch, thus far, has awakened any
interest, the writer will cheerfully communicate
some touching incidents connected with the
“soldier’s return home.” What is <em>your</em> opinion,
Mr. Merry?</p>

<span class="sc">pril</span> has stolen in upon us, and deserves
a welcome at our hands. In
our New England climate it is not
so gentle as in some other lands.
It brings us no flowers, but still,
the blue-bird and the robin visit us, and
tell us of a thousand pleasant things that
May and June will bring with them.
This month has been thus described by
a lively and pleasant writer.</p>

<p>“April,” says the author of the “Mirror
of the Months,” “is Spring&mdash;&#8203;the only
spring month that we possess&mdash;&#8203;at once
the most juvenile of all the months and
the most feminine, never knowing her
own mind for a day together. Fickle as
a fond maiden with her first lover, toying
it with the young sun, till he withdraws
his beams from her, and then
weeping till she gets them back again.
April is doubtless the sweetest month of
all the year; partly because it ushers in
the May, and partly for its own sake. It
is to the confirmed summer, what the
previous hope of joy is to the full fruition;
what the boyish dream of love is to love
itself. It is indeed the month of promises;
and what are twenty performances
compared with one promise? April, then,
is worth two Mays, because it tells of
May in every sigh that it breathes, and
every tear that it lets fall. It is the harbinger,
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="pageno">98</span>
the herald, the promise, the foretaste
of all the beauties that are to follow
it.”</p>

<span class="sc">S</span> evening approached, I
found myself quite fatigued,
and my feet almost
blistered from the heat of
the ground. I was therefore
very glad to see a
coffee plantation lying to the right, and
about a mile distant. Thither I went,
and applied to some of the negroes for a
night’s lodging, but found, however, that
not one of them could speak a word of
English,&mdash;&#8203;Dutch being the only language
with which they were acquainted.
Several of them got round me, chattering
like so many magpies.</p>

<p>Finding it impossible to make them
understand by words, I resorted to signs.
I suppose I must have been a pretty good
mimic, for they seemed to understand me
at once, and burst into the most <a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>uproarious
fits of laughter. They finally concluded
to take me to their master, whom
I found to be a great stout man, with a
swarthy complexion, and a farmer-like
appearance; but he, being a Dutchman,
could speak no English. The negroes,
however, interpreted my wishes, and the
planter gave immediate directions to have
me taken good care of. I was accordingly
carried off in triumph by my sable
friends, who treated me as well as if I
had been an emperor.</p>

<p>I never saw such a merry, kind-hearted
set of fellows. They got some
water, and one of them washed my sore
feet; another brought me a bowl of milk,
and a third spread my bed. After I had
rested for half an hour, I was called to
supper, and took my meal with the
planter and his family. They were all
very kind and polite. There was one
black-eyed girl,&mdash;&#8203;the planter’s daughter,
as I supposed,&mdash;&#8203;whom I thought very
handsome, but very different from our
New England girls. Her complexion
was extremely dark; her hair black as
jet, her skin being quite of an olive
color. When her features were at rest,
her countenance was pensive, almost
sad; but the moment she spoke, there
was a flash of cheerfulness over her
whole countenance. I stole several
glances at her, but being only a poor
sailor, I deemed this a kind of theft, and
tried hard not to be detected. I noticed,
however, that the maiden caught me
looking at her several times. I expected
she would be angry, but this was far
from being the case.</p>

<p>The habitation of the planter was
very different from a snug New England
dwelling. In this delicious climate
there is a perpetual summer; no
frost, no snow, no blustering Boreas
ever comes to chill the inhabitants, to
destroy the vegetation, or interrupt the
genial course of nature. Little is needed
for the comfort of the inhabitants, in respect
to a dwelling, but a mere shelter.
The planter’s residence consisted of
three or four distinct buildings, of irregular
shape and arrangement. One was
of brick, and covered with tiles; the
rest were of wood, and had more the
appearance of cattle sheds than human
<span class="pageno">99</span>
dwellings. There were no chimneys,
and the windows consisted of openings
without glass.</p>

<p>When it came night, I was put into one
of these buildings. We ascended to a
second loft by a ladder, and I laid down
upon a bed which consisted of straw.
Feeling very weary, I soon fell asleep.
I continued in a sound repose for several
hours, when, at last, I awoke suddenly.
It seemed as if I had heard some one
whispering to me, and in a sort of
dream, I fancied that it was the black-eyed
daughter of the planter. But when
I was fully awake, and rose up in my
bed, my amazement at what I beheld
was indescribable.</p>

<p>The moon was shining very brightly,
and lighted the large barn-like apartment
in such a manner, that I could see almost
every object with distinctness. Above
me, amid the dusky shadows of the
room, I beheld a creature of the most
extraordinary aspect. It seemed to have
the head of a rhinoceros, with most enormous
ears, the body of a bird, and the legs
of an alligator. It had immense wings,
shaped like those of a bat. To my excited
imagination, the creature seemed
as big as an ox; and as I gazed upon it,
it seemed to wave its prodigious wings,
and grin at me with a sneering and malicious
expression.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i038.jpg"
 width="60%"
 alt="Winged creature"
 />
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>My first idea was, that it was a mere
night-mare; but when I recollected that
I was in a strange country, and moreover
remembered the adventure of the alligator,
which had so recently occurred, I
began to conceive that it must be a
reality. There is no harm, at least,
thought I, in being prepared for the
worst. Accordingly, I reached out my
hand, and seized my cudgel. I then
laid down upon my bed, and keeping
my eye fixed upon the grisly apparition,
held myself ready for what might
happen. I kept myself perfectly still,
and at last the creature spread its wings
<span class="pageno">100</span>
and began to make a circuit through the
upper regions of the apartment.</p>

<p>Round and round he went, upon a
noiseless wing, and at last began to
make a dip at me. Never shall I forget
the sensations of that horrible moment!
The very uncertainty, whether it was a
reality, or some grisly phantom of the
brain, seemed to increase my agitation.
Could I have been sure that it was a
thing of flesh and blood, I should have
been ready to give it battle. But the
doubt, whether it was a being of this
world or another, seemed to freeze my
blood. I grasped my cudgel, but my
arm was paralyzed.</p>

<p>Thus I lay for several moments, while
the spectre wheeled round and round,
at every evolution, stooping lower and
lower, as he came near the place where
I lay. At last he paused in his flight,
and hovered over the foot of my bed.
I could distinctly feel his claws upon
my feet, as well as the fanning of
his wings, which were kept constantly
in motion. The sensation restored my
reason and my strength. I partially
arose in my bed, and struck a furious
blow with my cane at the monster. It
took effect, and it fell lifeless to the
floor. What was my surprise, on going
to the spot where the creature lay, to
discover that what my excited fancy
had exaggerated to the seeming dimensions
of a winged ox, was, in fact, not
bigger than a crow! It was one of
the huge bats common to Guiana, and
known by the name of the Vampire.
It had no doubt come to see how a little
blood drawn out of a Yankee boy’s great
toe would taste. But the fellow was mistaken
in his customer.</p>

<p>I now laid myself down upon my bed
but it was in vain that I attempted to
sleep. I lay for several hours, and finding
it impossible to repose, I went to the
window and looked forth upon the scene.
The moon was shining with wonderful
brightness, and from the eminence on
which the plantation stood, I had a distinct
view of the surrounding country.
The river Surinam shone like silver in
the distance, the air was filled with spicy
fragrance, and a kind of dazzling light
or silvery mist seemed to be diffused
throughout the whole space beneath the
sky. The whole aspect of nature and
the objects around me was strange, yet
lovely. There was a balmy softness in
the atmosphere, a kind of twilight splendor
over the face of nature, which excited
my admiration, and, at the same time,
gave me a sort of pensive and lonely
feeling, at the idea that I was far, very
far, from my home.</p>

<p>I remained at the window looking out
at the scene for some time. At last the
morning came, and before the sun had
risen, I went forth into the fields. An
immense extent of ground, belonging to
the plantation, was covered with coffee
trees. These were about ten feet in
height, planted in rows at the distance
of about ten feet from each other. They
somewhat resemble the peach tree; but
the leaves are longer, narrower, and
highly varnished. These trees, or rather
shrubs, are evergreens, and produce fruit
when they are about four years old.
They live to a great age&mdash;&#8203;sometimes a
hundred years. They were now covered
with large branches of white blossoms,
which gave forth a sweet odor.
The coffee berry grows in a kind of
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pageno">101</span>
fruit, which is red when ripe, and has
a very beautiful appearance upon the
trees.</p>

<p>After looking about the grounds for a
short time, I was returning to the house,
when I met the black-eyed daughter of
the planter. She bade me good morning,
in English, and, to my joy and surprise, I
found that she knew a few words of that
language. We tried to enter into conversation,
but without much success.
She asked me my name; and when I
told her it was Dick Boldhero, she manifested
much surprise and interest. She
spoke with great earnestness, and seemed
to have an intense desire to know something
more. At last, I saw the tears
come down her cheeks, and I felt an
emotion which I cannot describe. After
a time, we separated, and having taken
breakfast, I bade adieu to the plantation,
and set forward upon my journey.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">William Ellery Channing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span>
</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">D<span class="sc">r. Channing</span> was born at Newport,
Rhode Island, April 7th, 1780. His
father, William Channing, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, an
eminent lawyer of Newport, died in
the midst of his vigor, and at the height
of his professional success, when his son
William was in his fourteenth year. His
mother, was a daughter of William Ellery,
one of the signers of the Declaration
of Independence. She died in Boston,
in 1834. His father’s character
doubtless exerted an influence in forming
the mind of his son, but the nearer
intimacy, which, in the long period
through which his mother remained the
sole possessor of his filial regard, gave
her a peculiar power over him.</p>

<p>Dr. Channing is said to have been remarked
in early youth as singularly pure-minded,
devout, earnest, and aspiring&mdash;&#8203;leaving
his friends to anticipate from him
great excellence and eminence of character.
He graduated at Cambridge, Mass.,
in 1798, bearing with him the highest
honors of the institution, and having distinguished
himself for habits of diligence,
and for blamelessness of conduct. He
now accepted an invitation to reside a
year with a gentleman of Virginia, as
the instructor of his children. Here he
doubtless laid the foundation of that
feebleness of constitution which attended
him through life. Here, also, he probably
adopted the resolution to devote himself
to the ministry. He pursued his
professional studies, partly with his
uncle, <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Henry Channing, of New
London, Connecticut, and partly at Cambridge.</p>

<p>Mr. Channing received an invitation
to settle over the Church and Society in
Brattle Square, at the same time that he
received one from the Federal Street
Church. He chose to accept the latter;
his preference being determined “partly
by considerations of health, and partly by
diffidence;” his humility producing a distrust
of his own fitness for the office of a
Christian minister, that for a time was
painfully oppressive, and finally led him,
in connection with his health, to choose
<span class="pageno">102</span>
the less conspicuous and important of the
situations offered him.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>His ordination took place on the 1st
of June, 1803. An old copy of the
<cite>Columbian Centinel</cite> contains the following
notice: “Ordination.&mdash;Yesterday
was ordained to the pastoral care of the
Church in Federal Street, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Wm.
Ellery Channing. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Holmes
introduced the solemnity by prayer. Professor
Tappan delivered the sermon
from Eph. iii. 8, 9; the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Osgood
<span class="pageno">103</span>
made the ordaining prayer; the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Henry Channing gave the charge;
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Tuckerman expressed the
fellowship of the Church; and the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Dr. Eckley made the concluding prayer.
The ceremonial was conducted, and the
services performed, with a solemnity
and fervor suited to the occasion.”</p>

<p>Mr. Channing was appointed Dexter
Lecturer on Biblical Criticism in Harvard
University, in 1812, but his health
did not allow him to prepare a course of
lectures, and he resigned the appointment
the next year. In 1813 he was
elected a member of the Corporation, at
which board he retained a seat till 1826.
The University conferred on him the
honorary degree of D. D. in 1820.</p>

<p>Dr. Channing first appeared as a controversial
writer in 1815, when he addressed
his letter to <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> S. C. Thatcher,
“on the aspersions contained in a late
number of the Panoplist, of the ministers
of Boston and the vicinity.” This
led to a public correspondence between
him and the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Worcester, of
Salem. In 1819 he preached the sermon
at the ordination of Mr. Sparks, at
Baltimore, which produced the letters of
Professor Stuart, and of Drs. Wood and
Ware. In this sermon he took that position
in behalf of Unitarianism, which he
defended in many subsequent discourses,
on public occasions, and in his own pulpit.</p>

<p>Dr. Channing being very feeble, embarked
for Europe, in May, 1822, and
returned home in August, 1823. During
his absence, he visited Great Britain,
France, Switzerland, and Italy. In the
autumn of 1830 he was again compelled,
by his state of health, to leave the United
States, and passed the winter of 1830-31
in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix. One or two subsequent
winters he spent in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>He probably derived permanent benefit
from this absence to Europe, but still
there was such an habitual want of vigor
in his system, that, soon after his return,
he desired an assistant in his ministry;
and a colleague was settled in 1824.
From this time he continued to officiate
in the pulpit, with more or less frequency,
as his strength permitted, till
1840, when he requested the society to
release him from all obligation of professional
service, though he desired to
retain the pastoral connexion towards
them. As his mind was relieved from
the pressure of ministerial engagements,
his attention was more and more given
to the aspects which society, in its opinions,
usages, and institutions, presents to
the Christian philanthropist. He was
led, by his interest in these subjects, to
communicate to the public, at different
times, his thoughts on questions of immediate
urgency, involving high moral
considerations, and devoted a large part
of his time to an examination of the light
which Christianity throws upon practical
ethics.</p>

<p>Dr. Channing’s residence was in Boston,
but for several years he had been
accustomed to spend the summer in the
country, amidst those influences of nature
which he esteemed as even more grateful
in their effects upon the mind than
on the body. He chose his residence for
the season of 1842, among the mountains
that traverse the western section
of Massachusetts, in whose beautiful
seclusion he found a high degree of enjoyment,
and a firmer tone of health
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pageno">104</span>
than he had possessed for a long time.
On his journey homeward, by way of
Vermont, he was exposed to a temperature
unusual at the season, and too
severe for him to encounter with impunity,
which produced an access of disease,
that prevented his proceeding beyond
Bennington. Here his illness
steadily advanced till it overpowered the
vital energy; and what at first were the
slight apprehensions of his friends, were
converted into anxious fears, that only
gave place to the sorrows of bereavement.
He observed the progress of his
disease with the calmness that was habitual
with him in every situation;
expressed a sense of the Divine love
even beyond what he had before felt,
and manifested that exquisite tenderness
of affection, which gave such beauty to
his private life.</p>

<p>Dr. Channing’s illness extended over
twenty-six days. As is usual in autumnal
fevers, the action of the brain was
increased, and the mind was crowded
with subjects and images, which at times
occasioned him distress, as depriving
him of that control over his thoughts,
which in health, and under previous
attacks of disease, he habitually exercised.
The nature of his complaint, also,
made it necessary to avoid the excitement
of the pulse inevitable upon conversation,
and he therefore, as well as
those about him, abstained from long-continued
discourse. Still he said much
that can never be forgotten; and the
beautiful serenity, and the perfect trust
which he exhibited, made the apartment
in which he lay waiting for death, a place
of holy instruction, and peaceful sympathies.
He expressed a wish to die at
home, but yielded himself wholly to the
Divine will. His bodily suffering was
at no time extreme. Towards the close
of the disease there was an oppression
on the chest, and he sank rapidly. He
died at half past five o’clock, on Sunday,
October 2, 1820.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Chinese Ingenuity.</span>&mdash;The ingenuity
of the Chinese is too often exercised for
the purpose of fraud. Sometimes you
will buy a capon, as you may think, of a
Chinese, but find you have only the skin
of the bird, which has been so ingeniously
filled, that the deception is not
discovered until it is prepared for being
dressed.</p>

<p>They also make counterfeit hams.
These are made of pieces of wood, cut in
the form of a ham, and coated over with
a certain kind of earth, which is covered
with hog’s skin; and the whole is so ingeniously
prepared, that a knife is necessary
to detect the fraud.</p>

<p>A gentleman travelling in China some
few years ago, bought some chickens, the
feathers of which were curiously curled.
In a few days, he observed the feathers
straight, and that the chickens were of
the most common sort. The man who
sold them had curled the feathers of the
whole brood, a little while before he sold
them.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Morse.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">here</span> is only one species of this remarkable
animal, yet the singularity
of its appearance has procured for it a
variety of names, as the Walrus, the
Sea-Cow, the Sea-Horse, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> The only
animal which it resembles is the Seal.
It has two large tusks growing out of
the upper jaw, directed downwards.
From the high latitudes to which the
Morse is chiefly confined, there has been
but little ascertained respecting it. It is
not even known with certainty upon
what it feeds. Some suppose its food to
be entirely animal; whilst others have
represented it as feeding upon sea-weed.
It is probable, however, that it may turn
over the sea-weed with its long tusks, to
dislodge the animals upon which it
feeds, from the rocks.</p>

<p>The Morse is sometimes found eighteen
feet long, with tusks about two feet
in length. Its general color is brown.
It is a social animal, and resorts in great
numbers to favorite places on the far
northern coast, where it lies on rocks and
icebergs, till hunger compels it to resort
to the water for food. It is not active on
land, but its tusks enable it to climb up
high banks with facility.</p>

<p>The Morse is esteemed for the oil
which it affords. Their tusks also are
very valuable. They are hunted for
these articles, the ivory being harder
and whiter than that of the elephant.
When one of these animals is encountered
on the ice, or in the water, the
hunter strikes him with a strong harpoon
made expressly for this purpose.
The animal is then drawn to the nearest
flat iceberg. They then flay him, separate
the two tusks from the head, cut out
the fat, and carry it to the vessel. A
morse will furnish half a ton of oil.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Inquisitive Jack.</h3>

<p class="p2 center ls">CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="center"><cite>The poultry yard.</cite></p>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">I <span class="sc">shall</span> not undertake to tell the whole
history of the old hen and chickens,
whose story is begun in the preceding
chapter. If any of my readers meet
with Jack, who is now a man, they can
ask him, and he will tell them how the
greater part of the brood grew up to be
pullets or cockerels, and made a considerable
noise in the world. He will tell
them how the former at last became old
hens, and laid eggs, and cackled like
their ancestors; and how the latter,
after many funny trials, learned to crow,
and finally to fight, as their fathers and
grandfathers had done before them. I
must tell you, myself, what Jack said to
his aunt about this fighting.</p>

<p>He had watched the chickens with a
great deal of care, and he was greatly
diverted to see the little roosters, as soon
as they had little bits of red combs on
their heads, try to crow and fight.
They really seemed like some smart
boys we have seen, at the age of sixteen
or seventeen, trying to smoke cigars, or
drink wine, or some other liquor, and
appearing very ridiculous, while they
fancied that they were exciting the envy
and admiration of all around them, inasmuch
as they were imitating the deeds
of those older than themselves.</p>

<p>Jack laughed heartily at the ambitious
efforts of the cockerels, as well in
boasting as in battle&mdash;&#8203;until, one day, he
saw two of them fight till their heads
were bloody, and one of them had his
eyes picked out. This shocked him
<span class="pageno">107</span>
greatly, and his heart being grieved, he
went to tell what had happened to his
aunt. She tried to comfort him as well
as she could, but, at last, he spoke to her
as follows: “You told me, aunt Betsey,
that these creatures were governed by
instinct, and that this instinct was implanted
by God. You said that the obedience
of the chickens to their parent was of
this nature, and furnished a good example
to children. Now, I wish to ask
if the fighting of the cockerels is not
implanted by God, and therefore a good
example to children?”</p>

<p>Aunt Betsey smiled at the shrewdness
of this question, and seeing that it was
asked in earnest, and not scoffingly, by
Jack, she replied seriously in these
words: “I do not suppose, Jack, that
instinct is the only guide of animals.
It is their guide when young, but when
they are older and know how to take
care of themselves, then I suppose that
in many things they act freely and from
their own sense and judgment. When
you were an infant you were guided by
instinct, but now that you are older, you
act freely, according to your choice.
You may fight, or you may be peaceful,
just as you please. Having arrived at
this period, you are responsible for your
conduct, for it has pleased God to make
you free. It is just so, I think, with
these young cockerels; they may fight,
or let it alone. If they fight and get
bloody noses, they only are to blame.
And if they do fight, it is no example
for us. God has given human beings a
law of peace, and this should be their
rule. Dr. Watts has said,</p>

<p>“But it is quite otherwise with human
beings; even if brute animals are left to
tear each other in pieces, mankind are
taught that peace, kindness and harmony
are not only the duty, but the happiness
of the human race.”</p>

<p>From observing the hen and her
chickens, Jack’s attention was drawn to
the other inhabitants of the poultry yard.
The strutting turkey, the hissing, gobbling
goose, the waddling duck, the
screaming guinea-hen, and the fantastic
peacock, each in turn became the subject
of his investigation, and each seemed
to him to have a character and interest
peculiar to itself. If I had the power
faithfully to paint all his feelings, and
space to detail all his thoughts, I could
make the story entertaining, but I must
content myself with a very general
account of the matter.</p>

<p>I believe there are very few persons
who have not been often amused in
pausing for a half hour and noticing the
various airs, manners and customs, of
the feathered inhabitants of the poultry
yard. The hen, stealing to her nest,
deposits her eggs, and then comes forth
with an obstreperous cackle, to tell everybody
what she has been about.</p>

<p>The rooster&mdash;he that is “cock of the
walk,” leads forth his body of hens, and
when he finds a good fat grub, calls his
favorites to come and feast on the delicate
morsel. Like a polite old beau, he
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="pageno">108</span>
seems to prefer the happiness of the
other sex to his own; his tones and
manner are soft and insinuating, and he
becomes the very personification of gallantry.
While he is thus tender to the
females of the flock, he is harsh and
unsparing to his rivals of the masculine
gender. If one of them comes near, he
is sure to feel his spurs, and, after the
rebuke, to hear the shrill triumphant
crow of the conqueror.</p>

<p>The turkey-cock struts round and round,
grating the edges of his wings upon the
ground, and displays his purple wattles,
his crimson comb, and his black, bristly
beard, to the admiring gaze of the tender,
transcendental hens of his flock. The
guinea-hen, creeping afar, amid some
thicket, comes running home with a terrible
cry, as if thieves, robbers and murderers
were at hand! The peacock, situated
upon some conspicuous mound, spreads
out his tail, set with a thousand gorgeous
gems, and, lost in admiration, appears to
enjoy a sublime self-conceit. Amid all
this exultation, the vulgar duck is dabbling
in the mud, only deigning to utter
his quack&mdash;&#8203;quack&mdash;&#8203;quack, at intervals,
few and far between. At the same time,
the silent and sentimental goose is
swimming upon the bosom of the muddy
pool, now and then plunging its long neck
into the recesses of the element upon
which it floats&mdash;&#8203;happy if perchance some
insect, lizard, or tadpole may reward its
search.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that these
amusing scenes escaped the sharp observation
of Inquisitive Jack. He indeed,
noticed the peculiarities of the several
kinds of poultry, and had many a long
conversation upon the subject with his
aunt Betsey. We can only note the
substance of what she told him.</p>

<p>The domestic fowls are the descendants
of birds originally wild. The barn-door
cock and hen came in the first place
from Asia, and in some parts of India
they are still to be met with, though their
appearance is somewhat different from
that of the tame breeds. The peacock
came also from Asia, and the guinea-hen
from Africa. The duck is but a tame
mallard, a bird which is often shot
along our coasts. The honest goose is
descended from the wild gray bird, that
is often seen in flocks, in spring time,
high in air, and in the shape of a triangle,
wending their way to the far north,
where they may breed in solitude, peace
and safety.</p>

<p>The turkey is the only original bird
of America among our poultry. It was
found in the forests, when the Europeans
first visited this continent. It is
less changed by domestication than any
other bird. If you were to see it in the
wilds of the west, where flocks of it are
still common, you would think it only a
truant turkey which had strayed from the
barn-yard. It is a strutting, vain, cowardly
bird, though it is very good eating.
The French call it <dfn>dinde</dfn>, and hence our
word <em>dandy</em>, which means a vain, cowardly
coxcomb.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><cite>The story of the lottery ticket, continued.</cite></p>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">homas Trudge</span> was now one of the
richest men in the town of Buckwheat,
in which he resided, and it
was not long before his good fortune
was known over the whole place. A
great many people came to see him and
talk with him about it, and hear the
whole story from beginning to end.
They desired also to see the money, and
make sure that it was real, good money;
for many of them could hardly believe
that a poor pedlar should draw a prize of
fifty thousand dollars. A great many
persons also came to see Mr. and Mrs.
Trudge, who had never been in their
humble cottage before; and Mrs. Trudge
was not slow to observe that the people
now called her husband Mr. Trudge, instead
of Tom, and herself, Mrs. Trudge,
instead of Bridget.</p>

<p>The town of Buckwheat consisted of
about two thousand inhabitants, who
were chiefly devoted to agriculture. It
derived its name from its producing a
large quantity of that particular kind of
grain which is famous for feeding poultry
and making flap-jacks. It consisted
of two villages, which bore the titles of
Up-town and Down-town. In the former
portion, there dwelt several families
of some wealth, who had removed
thither from the city of New York,
during the war of the revolution, to
escape from the dangers and anxieties
of that period. These families, having
similar tastes and habits of life, naturally
associated together, and were hence
called the aristocracy.</p>

<p>The leader of fashion among this
portion of the community was a dashing
widow, by the name of Mrs. Million.
She was rich, and so long as she was
flattered and permitted to have her own
way, she was hospitable and good-natured;
but if thwarted, or if her superiority
in all respects were called into
question, she was haughty, ill-natured,
and vindictive.</p>

<p>While such was the state of things
at Up-town, there was also a natural
association formed by the people in that
portion of the place called Down-town.
“Birds of a feather flock together,”
says the adage; and, accordingly, the
Down-towners, being drawn together by
similar tastes, habits and condition, associated
with each other, and were called
the democracy. For a long time, these
names were not in use in Buckwheat,
and the people, whatever inequality in
their condition might exist, got along
very peaceably together. But when
they began to call each other names,
such as aristocrat and democrat, a feeling
of hostility grew up among them,
and it was not long before bad blood
was excited between them. Hitherto, all
things had gone on peaceably; every
person was at liberty to do as he pleased,
provided there was nothing improper in
his conduct; but now that these ugly
names had got in among them, there
was a great deal of scandal and back-biting
abroad. It really seemed as if the
introduction of these two words&mdash;&#8203;aristocracy
and democracy&mdash;&#8203;into the good
old town of Buckwheat, did as much to
break up the peace and harmony of the
people, as if two evil spirits had taken
up their residence there, and had exerted
<span class="pageno">110</span>
themselves to set the inhabitants by the
ears.</p>

<p>Thomas Trudge was naturally a fair-minded,
honest, good-hearted fellow, and,
left to himself, would never have made
any trouble in the world. But his partner,
Bridget, was restless, meddlesome,
and ambitious. She was always talking
about the Up-towners, and nothing happened
there, but it was the occasion of
some sour and satirical reflection upon
her part. She kept an especial watch
upon Mrs. Million, particularly at the
meeting on Sunday. Her dress was
then thoroughly scanned, and if she
ventured to come out with a new bonnet,
gown, frill, or even ribbon, the amiable
Bridget was sure to exclaim somewhat
in this manner: “Shame upon
that Mrs. Million, to be perking herself
up in church with her new finery, to attract
the attention of the whole congregation!
What is Mrs. Million, that she presumes
to catch all the best of the minister’s
discourse&mdash;&#8203;the corn and the kernel&mdash;&#8203;and
leave nothing but the husks for
such people as we are. Oh, it’s because
she’s rich, I suppose! But the tables
will be turned, by and by. ‘Every dog
must have his day!’ Dives had his, and
Mrs. Million is having hers; but there’s
another world to settle these accounts in!”</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that Bridget
Trudge was a bad woman, even though
she indulged in such spiteful words; her
bark was a great deal worse than her
bite. But still, people who get into the
habit of talking harshly, will ere long
feel and act harshly&mdash;&#8203;and so it was with
Bridget. She had been so accustomed
to indulge her love of scandal towards
the Up-towners, that she seemed to hate
them; and as to Mrs. Million, she felt
as if she owed her some particular
grudge; and this was the more curious,
from the fact that Mrs. Million had
always treated Bridget with kindness,
and had made her various presents of
considerable value. Nothing, however,
in the conduct of the Up-towners, could
satisfy Mrs. Trudge. Their behavior,
in her view, was all wrong. She accused
them of being extravagant, worldly-minded,
dissipated, and, what was ten
times worse than all, aristocratic.</p>

<p>Entertaining such views as these, it
may seem strange that the first idea of
Mrs. Trudge, after she had settled it in
her mind that they were rich, was, that
she would become one of the Up-towners,
join the aristocracy, and out-dash Mrs.
Million. Her first great manœuvre was
developed on the second Sunday after
the drawing of the prize. Her husband
went in his usual dress, but Mrs. Trudge
appeared in all the glory of her new
changeable damask, decorated with figures
in gold. It was made in the height
of the fashion; and as she flaunted up
the broad aisle, you might have fancied
that she was going to a masquerade.
An enormous red satin bonnet, with huge
bunches of ribbons, red shoes and a tall
fan&mdash;&#8203;though it was now November&mdash;&#8203;served
to aid the conceit. The little
Trudges followed their mother, fantastically
attired, while Tom, the pedlar, in
his rusty, brown suit, brought up the rear.</p>

<p>The Scottish poet, Burns, has said a
great many good things; and among
these is the following couplet:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">“Oh! would kind heaven the giftie gie us</div>
<div class="i1">To see oursels as ithers see us.”</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span class="pageno">111</span>
Mrs. Trudge supposed that on the
present occasion she was exciting the
admiration of all Buckwheat; that she
was provoking the envy of the proud
Mrs. Million, and that she was conquering
the respect of the Up-towners. The
text happened to be the story of Lazarus
in Abraham’s bosom, and was used by
the preacher to show the compensations
which are to be made to the humble
Christian in a future world, for the sorrows,
suffering and poverty of this. Mrs.
Trudge made a curious, though flattering
application of the text to herself.
“Yes, yes,” said she, internally, “the
poor shall be comforted&mdash;&#8203;those who have
suffered shall have the reward. I have
endured poverty and suffering, and now
I am taken to Abraham’s bosom.” She
enjoyed great satisfaction in this view of
the case, and, for the first time in her
life, fondly fancied that the preacher
intended to bestow upon her the comforts
of Scripture.</p>

<p>It is not our purpose to detail the
various steps by which the Trudges
changed their position in society. It
will be sufficient to say that they left
their humble cottage and entered a new
house, which they caused to be built
upon the very top of Up-town! This
was constructed in the most approved
style; and the grounds around were
duly decorated with gravel-walks, avenues,
flower-beds, shrubbery, and long
straight rows of Lombardy poplars. Here,
they gave tea-parties and suppers; and
in the course of two years rejoiced in
considering themselves as making a part
of that aristocracy which Mrs. Trudge
had before regarded as so hateful.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Leming.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">he</span> Leming, which is a native of
Scandinavia, is somewhat larger than
a dormouse, having a short, bushy
tail. Its fore legs are short, and its
hind ones are long, which give it a degree
of swiftness. It is particularly remarkable
for its migrations, in which
many millions remove from their native
mountains and descend like a torrent upon
the plains. They move, for the most part,
in a square, marching forward by night
and lying still by day. Thus, like an
animated torrent, they are often seen
more than a mile broad, covering the
ground, and that so thick, that the hindmost
touches the leader.</p>

<p>It is in vain that the poor inhabitant
resists or attempts to stop their progress,
they still keep moving forward, and
though thousands are destroyed, myriads
are seen to succeed, and make their
destruction impracticable. They generally
move in lines, which are about
three feet from each other, and exactly
parallel. Their march is always directed
from the north-west to the south-east,
and regularly conducted from the beginning.
Wherever their motions are
turned, nothing can stop them; they
go directly forward, impelled by some
strange power; and from the time they
first set out, they never once think of retreating.
If a lake or a river happens to
intercept their progress, they all together
take to the water and swim over it; a fire,
a deep well, or a torrent, does not turn
them out of their direction; they boldly
plunge into the flames, or leap down
the well, where they are sometimes seen
climbing up on the other side.</p>

<p>If they are interrupted by a boat
across a river, while they are swimming,
they never attempt to swim round
it, but mount directly up its sides, and
the boatmen, who know how vain resistance
in such a case may be, calmly suffer
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pageno">113</span>
the living torrent to pass on, which it
does without further damage. If they
meet with a stack of hay or corn that
interrupts their passage, instead of going
over it, they gnaw their way through.
It is happy, however, for mankind, that
they eat nothing that is prepared for
human subsistence; they never enter a
house to destroy the provisions, but are
contented with eating every root and
vegetable that they meet. If they happen
to pass through a meadow, they
destroy it in a very short time, and give
it the appearance of being burnt up and
strewed with ashes.</p>

<p>An enemy so numerous and destructive
would quickly render the countries
where they appear, utterly uninhabitable,
did it not fortunately happen that the
same rapacity that animates them to destroy
the labor of mankind, at last impels
them to destroy and devour each other.
After committing incredible devastation,
they are at last seen to separate into two
armies, opposed with deadly hatred, and
they continue their engagements till one
party overcomes the other. From that
time they utterly disappear; some suppose
that they rush headlong into the
sea; others that they kill themselves;
but the most probable opinion is, that
having devoured the vegetable productions
of the country, they fall to devouring
one another. However this may
be, they are found dead by thousands,
and their carcasses have been known to
infect the air for several miles around,
so as to produce very malignant disorders.</p>

<p>The Swedes and Norwegians, who
live by husbandry, consider an invasion
from these vermin as a terrible visitation;
but it is very different with respect to the
Laplanders, who lead a vagrant life like
the beings themselves. They are never
so happy as when an army of these
creatures come down amongst them, for
then they have a feast upon their flesh,
which they esteem very good eating,
although rejected both by cats and dogs.</p>

<p class="drop-img">
<span class="drop-img"><img src="images/drop_l.jpg"
width="75"
 alt="X" /></span>
<span class="sc">et</span> us now proceed with our
promised account of some of
the most remarkable manners
and customs of the great
tribes of Indians, which occupy
the western portion of
the United States. Among the chief
tribes, are the Osages, Pawnees, Choctaws,
Creeks, Cherokees, Sacs and
Foxes, Assineboins, and Winnebagoes.
To the north, are the Blackfeet and the
Chippewas. There are also several
smaller tribes. These occupy the great
tract of country which lies immediately
west of the Rocky Mountains; on the
other side of that range are a multitude
of other tribes. All these Indians are
supposed to amount to between two and
three hundred thousand.</p>

<p>The people of these different tribes
speak different languages, though these
<span class="pageno">114</span>
have some resemblance. In their personal
appearance, there is little to distinguish
them. They are all copper-colored,
with small black eyes, and high cheek
bones. The hair is invariably black in
youth, turning gray in age. It is coarse
and lank, resembling horse hair. It is
very glossy&mdash;&#8203;a quality which is increased
by the use of grease.</p>

<p>The men are tall and well shaped;
their arms are small, but their legs are
very stout. They can endure long abstinence
from food, and run for a great distance
with speed. They have not, however,
the strength and endurance of the
white man. In a personal conflict, where
strength and energy of purpose are required,
the white man will generally
overcome the Indian.</p>

<p>The women are much shorter than
the men, and are capable of performing
a great deal of labor. All the drudgery
of the household falls to their lot. The
warrior and the hunter cannot stoop to
the cultivation of the soil, or any of the
ordinary business of life. In travelling
from one part of the country to another,
the women carry heavy burdens, take the
entire charge of the furniture, pitch the
tents, gather the fuel, and kindle the
fires; cut up and dress the meat, besides
taking care of the children.</p>

<p>Some of the tribes are stationary and
live in villages, their houses being made
of stone and mortar covered with coarse
thatch. These tribes carry on some
agriculture, and produce corn, pumpkins,
and beans. They frequently send
out hunting parties, who furnish a supply
of meat from the buffaloes, deer,
bear, and other quadrupeds.</p>

<p>Other tribes have permanent villages,
built like the preceding, which however
are occupied only in winter. In spring,
they plant their grounds, and then, taking
their tents, set forward, and spend their
summer in roaming from place to place,
chiefly for the purpose of obtaining game.
The men spend their time in war and the
chase, and the women in performing
household duties. During these excursions,
they seem for the most part to live
a happy, careless life, though they sometimes
suffer from the attacks of their
enemies. About the middle of autumn,
they return and take up their abode at
their winter residence. Here they gather
their harvest, which is now ripened.</p>

<p>Besides the great business of war and
the chase, the Indian men carry on a considerable
traffic in the hides of the animals
they kill. White traders frequently
visit their settlements, and, in
exchange for their furs, give them various
trinkets, blankets, knives, hatchets,
powder, ball and fire-arms, together with
rum and whiskey, the great bane of the
Indian. The amusements of these savages
are chiefly found in the serious
pursuits of life, war, and the chase.
Their councils, also, in which the leading
men make great speeches, excite a
deep and lively interest. Besides these
sources of pleasure, the Indian men are
very much addicted to various kinds of
dances; in these they represent their
feats in battle and the chase. The women
take no part in such sports, except
as spectators.</p>

<p>A great source of amusement with the
Indian men is found in personal decorations.
They pluck out their beards
with the utmost care, probably that they
may paint themselves with the more
<span class="pageno">115</span>
facility. They now use tweezers made
of wire, but they formerly used muscle-shells,
the edges of which were ground
smooth. The operation is performed
with a jerk, like that commonly used in
plucking a goose.</p>

<p>They paint their bodies in various
colors, with various devices. They decorate
themselves with necklaces of bear’s-claws,
head-pieces consisting of the pate
and horns of the buffalo, and ornamented
robes of buffalo skins. They also wear
feathers in their hair; the chief idea in
these decorations seems to be to present
a fierce and startling appearance.</p>

<p>The chief amusement of the women,
aside from their laborious duties, seems
to be found in gossiping. They never
mingle in the sports of the men, but
seem to take great pleasure in witnessing
them. They are little addicted to
finery, and dandyism is almost wholly
given up to the sterner sex. Notwithstanding
that they are the mere slaves
of the men, they are talkative, lively and
cheerful, and seem to possess a good
deal of that sympathy and kindness of
heart common to women in all conditions
of society.</p>

<p>As I have said, the Indians have no
books, no schools, and no churches.
Their knowledge is almost wholly confined
to the tract of country in which
they live and the few arts they practise.
They believe in the existence of a great
and good Spirit, and also an evil Spirit.
They believe that they shall exist in a
future state; if they perform their part
well in this life, they hope to enjoy a
paradise in the next, fashioned after
their notions of happiness. The Indian,
about to die, addresses his mind to the
Great Spirit, setting forth his feats in
battle and the chase, and expresses the
hope that in the future state, he shall be
surrounded by obedient squaws, roam
over rich prairies, feed on fat buffaloes,
and find no prickly pear to wound his
feet. The Indians are superstitious, and
believe in the efficacy of various charms.
They have sorcerers, who pretend to cure
diseases by their incantations.</p>

<p>Mankind in all countries are formed
by the circumstances in which they live.
The savages of the western wilds have
those faculties sharpened, which are
called into frequent exercise. Those
who have horses become very expert
riders. The hunter and the warrior
have a keenness of sight, and a nicety
of observation, which are truly wonderful.
It is related that a hunter belonging
to one of the western tribes, on his
return home one day to his hut, discovered
that his venison, which he had hung
up to dry, had been stolen. After taking
observations upon the spot, he set off in
pursuit of the thief, whom he tracked
through the woods. Having gone a
little distance, he met some persons, of
whom he inquired if they had seen a
<em>little old white man</em>, with a <em>short gun</em>,
accompanied by a <em>small dog</em> with a <em>short
tail</em>? They replied in the affirmative;
and upon the Indian assuring them that
the man thus described had stolen his
venison, they desired to be informed how
he was able to give so minute a description
of a person he had not seen.</p>

<p>The Indian replied thus,&mdash;&#8203;“The thief
I know is a <em>little</em> man, by his having
made a pile of stones to stand upon in
order to reach the venison from the
height I hung it, standing on the ground;
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><span class="pageno">116</span>
that he is an old man, I know by his
short steps which I have traced over the
dead leaves in the woods; and that he is
a white man, I know by his turning <em>out</em>
his toes when he walks, which an Indian
never does. His gun I know to be <em>short</em>,
by the mark the muzzle made in rubbing
the tree on which it leaned; that his dog
is small, I know by his tracks; and that
he has a <em>short tail</em>, I discovered by the
mark it made in the dust where he was
sitting at the time his master was taking
down the meat.”</p>

<p>This story shows that savages are
very sharp in little matters to which
their circumstances have directed their
attention. But how great is their ignorance
of many important subjects! They
have no idea of geography, beyond their
own travels! They do not know the
shape of the world&mdash;&#8203;its vast magnitude,
its mighty rivers, its boundless oceans,
or the nations and kingdoms with which
it is covered. They know nothing of
Europe, or Asia, or Africa. They know
nothing of astronomy except from what
they see, and the highest conception they
have of the stars is that they are fires
with which the Great Spirit lights his
pipe. They know nothing of the great
truths of the Bible, and they conceive
the Deity to be a being possessing
nearly the same qualities as themselves.
How fearful is the darkness which rests
upon uncivilized, unchristianized man,
and how thankful should we be for the
advantages bestowed upon us by the light
of knowledge and truth of revelation!</p>

<span class="sc">eldom</span> has there been a gayer
party than the one assembled
to celebrate Phillipina’s wedding.
The bride herself was
in excellent spirits, and her
husband, Bob, danced, frisked, and flourished
as if he were mad with delight.
The whole company, indeed, seemed
like a parcel of happy children, heedless
of the past, careless of the future,
and only intent upon enjoying the passing
moment. They were all slaves,
bought and sold like merchandize, but
they seemed not to think of that. The
banjo struck up its liveliest measure,
and the bride and groom opened the
ceremonies with a waltz. How Phillipina
did swim round the room, turning,
twisting and twirling about, like a crazy
peg-top! Mounted upon her head, I
performed my part, and having been
nicely starched, and extending to the
height of half a yard, you may believe I
made rather a conspicuous figure. The
pure white of my complexion set off
Phillipina’s glistening skin to great advantage.
As we went waltzing round
the room, I heard some compliments
upon the loveliness of the bride, but many
more as to the beauty of the turban.</p>

<p>“Well, it was a happy night. We
<span class="pageno">117</span>
danced ‘Coal black Rose,’ ‘Possum up a
gum-tree,’ and many other favorite measures
of the kind; but as this was some
years ago, ‘Jim Crow’ and the ‘Cachucha’
had not got into vogue. At a late hour,
the party broke up, and on the morrow,
I was laid upon the shelf. For several
weeks, I was occasionally called into
service to attend at parties made for the
bride and groom, after which, I had a
long repose in a box, with a bunch of
artificial flowers, some tousled ribbons,
and other old finery.</p>

<p>“What length of time now passed, I
cannot say, but after a long space, there
was a rummaging in the box, and on
looking up, I perceived that Phillipina
had come to take me out. The poor
creature had a very sad aspect, and tears
as bright as those that fall from any
eyes, coursed down her cheeks. I soon
learned the cause of this. Her husband
had been sold to a planter, who lived in
the interior, and had left her forever.
Thus, what the church had joined together,
man had put asunder, agreeably
to the laws and customs of that Christian
land. Nor was this all. Phillipina had
been purchased by a Portuguese nobleman,
to attend his lady; and the whole
party were immediately to proceed to
Portugal!</p>

<p>“My mistress, who had a heart, notwithstanding
her complexion, took leave
of her friends, shed many tears, and we
went on board the ship. During the
voyage, I was packed away with my old
companions, the faded flowers, and tousled
ribbons. We reached Lisbon, and
after a few months, we proceeded toward
the country seat of Phillipina’s master&mdash;&#8203;a
fine castle upon the mountains, on the
borders of Spain. As we were passing
through a deep and dark ravine, our
party was attacked by robbers; a desperate
scuffle ensued between our company
and that of the banditti, but the latter at
last prevailed, and taking our entire baggage,
hurried it away into the recesses
of the mountains. I was taken with the
rest, and thus was forever separated from
Phillipina.</p>

<p>“When I next saw the light, it was in
a splendid castle. The robbers had selected
the choicest articles from their
booty, and one of them, assuming the
disguise of a pedlar, took these to the
castle. I was purchased by the lady, a
stately dame, with beautiful black eyes,
black hair, and a soft, but melancholy
expression of countenance. She paid
for me an enormous price, and after the
pedlar was gone, she sat down and gazed
at me with a delighted look. I may say
it without vanity, those fair eyes had
never before looked upon a piece of muslin,
so sheer, even and dazzling. Phillipina&mdash;&#8203;thanks
to the kind-hearted creature!&mdash;&#8203;had
put me in the best condition;
and behold, the slave’s turban now the
favorite of a duchess!</p>

<p>“Nothing could exceed the gloomy
magnificence of the castle in which I now
dwelt. It stood upon the brow of a lofty
rock, from the battlements of which, you
looked down upon a valley threaded by
a silver stream, and dotted over with
vineyards and groves of olive, lemon,
and orange trees. The air was filled
with the most delicious fragrance, and
far as the eye could reach, the lovely
valley seemed to stretch out, presenting
a scene of luxuriance and peace. On
the other side of the castle, was a succession
<span class="pageno">118</span>
of rugged mountains, covered
with gloomy forests of cork trees, with
occasional groups of oak and chestnut.
The view resembled a sea of waving
leaves covered by a thin atmospheric
veil of a purple hue. Nothing could
exceed the grandeur and richness of the
spectacle.</p>

<p>“The castle was itself a kind of village,
where there were at least a hundred
people. Its master was a duke, of
an ancient family, and bearing at least a
dozen titles attached to his name. He
was a dark, sallow and gloomy man, yet
very handsome. He bore a military title,
and had served in the wars. There was
about him a stern, stately demeanor, befitting
the soldier, yet, when he addressed
the fair duchess, his manner was gentle
and winning.</p>

<p>“The dame, however, for some cause,
was unhappy. Still youthful, she spent
her time in seclusion, and seemed to devote
almost all her thoughts to religious
duties and ceremonies. I learned that
she had been married contrary to her
inclination, and that in the midst of the
luxuries that surrounded her, she was
far less happy than the menials about the
castle. In vain were all the attentions
of her lord to soothe her melancholy.
The heart was given to another, and her
happiness had gone with it.</p>

<p>“The lady had no books, save a few
old Spanish ballads, and these she had
learned by heart. She took an occasional
drive; sometimes sauntered
through the magnificent gardens attached
to the castle, but more frequently
buried herself amid the dark labyrinths
of the park, where she sometimes met
a cavalier, who kissed her hand, and
departed, leaving her in tears. With
these exceptions, the lady spent the
greater part of her time in the little
chapel of the castle, on her knees, before
the image of the Virgin, and in her
boudoir engaged in needle work.</p>

<p>“A new thought now occurred to her,
which was to work me into a handkerchief
for the Virgin in the chapel. This
design was immediately entered upon,
and industriously pursued for more than
a year. Some tears fell upon me during
that period, but they were too bright to
leave any stain behind. At last I was
finished, and after a meeting between the
lady and the strange cavalier in the wood,
I was one evening placed around the neck
of the holy mother’s image, and fastened
with a diamond of inestimable value.</p>

<p>“I had scarcely remained a month in
this condition, when, one night, a person,
whose features I could not discover, entered
the chapel, took the diamond pin,
and crossing himself repeatedly before
the Virgin, telling his beads, and saying
a number of ‘ave marias,’ he went away.
The theft was not discovered, for a paste
pin was put in the place of the stolen
jewel. Not long after this, an attack
was made upon the castle by a party of
French soldiers. It was bravely defended
by the duke and his attendants, but without
avail. He escaped with his fair
dame through some of the winding passages;
and their further story I am
unable to tell. My own fate was melancholy
indeed. One of the cannon pierced
the chapel, and striking the breast of
the holy Virgin, scattered the image in
a thousand fragments. Torn and blackened,
I was thrown upon the floor, by
the side of a bleeding soldier. He took
<span class="pageno">119</span>
me up, to staunch his wound, and when
he was carried away by his comrades, I
was taken with him.</p>

<p>“His wound was not serious; and
after a short space, I was thrust into his
pocket, stained with blood. For several
weeks, I performed the office of wiping
the fellow’s nose. Thus I was reduced
to the most miserable and degraded condition.
At last I was thrust into the soldier’s
knapsack, and for a long period,
travelled about with him. My companions
consisted of a wad of lint, an old
cigar, the handle of a jack-knife, a little
black cross, an old seal-skin purse, besides
sundry damaged articles of dress.</p>

<p>“After a great variety of marches and
countermarches, the soldier was finally
wounded in battle, and carried to some
barracks. Here he was stretched out
upon a bed of straw, with several other
miserable wretches. They were visited
once a day by the surgeon, and every
morning the man with the dead-cart
came round to carry away those who
had expired. The dead-cart-men had
become so hardened as to perform their
office with as much indifference as if
they were dealing with so many sacks
of salt. If they could perceive no
motion in the bodies, they would seize
upon them and carry them away, hardly
pausing to consider whether they were
yet dead. So long as life and consciousness
remained, the poor soldiers were
accustomed to give a kick as these
hearsemen performed their rounds, in
order to save themselves from being
borne away to the charnel-house. One
morning no motion was perceived in my
poor soldier. He had given his last
kick, and he was borne to his grave.
His knapsack was left behind, and I
became the plunder of one of the attendants
of the hospital.</p>

<p>“For a time, I remained with a heap
of rubbish, where I found myself with a
parcel of old rags, each of which could
have told a tale, perhaps, as curious as
my own. There was an old shirt, which
had belonged to a man who had died of
the plague; a pocket handkerchief, spun
by the silk-worms of India, and manufactured
by Hindoo artizans, and after
being borne to Europe, had ministered
to the conveniences of at least three
different persons; an old frill which had
flourished upon the bosom of a beau, and
sundry other fragments equally curious.
After a long space, we were bundled
together, taken to the city of Cadiz,
packed in an enormous bale, and shipped
to Boston.</p>

<p>“Thus, I made my fourth voyage
across the Atlantic, and found myself
restored to the country of my birth. I
had passed through various adventures,
but alas, what was my present condition!
How sadly did it contrast with the
brighter days of my existence. Once
the favorite of a duchess; once the ornament
of the holy Virgin, and fit to be
decorated with a priceless gem; now an
old rag tumbled in, cheek by jowl, with
a thousand vulgar fragments of shirts,
sheets, and nose-wipers.</p>

<p>“I did not remain in this condition
long. I was soon purchased by Messrs.
Tileston &amp; Hollingsworth, and transported
to their mill at Dorchester; and
here I am awaiting my fate. And what
is that to be? Am I to be manufactured
into a pure sheet, upon which Mr. Longfellow
shall write one of his beautiful
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="pageno">120</span>
sonnets; or make an immortal leaf in a
new edition of Prescott’s Cortez; or shall
I go gilt-edged, to some fair lady, and
receive her confession to her lover; or
shall I be impressed with the magic
figures of a bank, and bear a value a
hundred times my weight in gold; or
shall I go to the office of a penny paper,
and be cried about the streets by the boys,&mdash;&#8203;‘Here’s
the second edition of the Mail,
Bee, and Times, with a full account of
the last horrible murder!’”</p>

<p>Thus I read, or seemed to read, from
the scroll, which the haggish old rag
in the bin had put into my hands. As
I finished the last sentence recorded
above, the paper shrunk from my grasp.
At the same instant, I saw the grisly
image rise again from the rag-bin, but
with a look so portentous, that I trembled
in every limb. In the agony of the
moment, I uttered a shriek, which awoke
me, and behold, “The Reminiscences of
a Rag” were but a dream!</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Persia.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">he</span> present kingdom of Persia, called
Ivan by the natives, covers a space
of four hundred and fifty thousand
square miles, lying between 25° and
40° N. latitude, and 44° and 62° E. longitude,
constituting an elevated table
land. On the east and north are extensive
plains, and on the south lie the Persian
Gulf and the Indian Sea. To the east
are the kingdoms of Afghanistan, and
Beloochistan. The climate of Persia
varies in the different portions. To the
<span class="pageno">121</span>
north it is cold; in the inland provinces
the air is serene and pure; but in the south
it is hot, and the wind often proves fatal
to health. There are but few rivers, and
water is very scarce. In some parts of
Persia, the soil is unfruitful, but the luxuriance
in other spots is wonderful. The
vale of Shiraz is much celebrated for the
salubrity of the air, and the richness and
variety of its fruits and flowers. Near
Ispahan, are cultivated all the beautiful
flowers that can be conceived, particularly
roses, from which is made the celebrated
otto of rose, held by ladies in such
high esteem. Here the pomegranate
tree grows wild, delighting the eye with
its splendid red blossom.</p>

<p>In Persia, there are a great variety of
wild animals and birds. In some places,
the lion holds his sway; in others, wolves,
jackals, and foxes abound. Leopards,
lynxes, and bears are very numerous.
One of the most remarkable animals is
the argali, or mountain sheep. But the
most beautiful creature is the gazelle, so
justly celebrated for its grace and agility.</p>

<p>There are many tribes in Persia,
many of whom live a wandering life.
The Persians are distinguished for their
politeness and learning. The Turkish
is the common language; the Persian
being only spoken by the people of science
and literature.</p>

<p>The Persians are generally a handsome
race. Their dress is peculiar and
fitted to their climate. The men wear a
long robe, wide trousers, and a silk or
calico shirt. Robes of various kinds are
worn, tied by a muslin sash. In this is
stuck a dagger; and a sword is considered
a necessary appendage to the dress
of every Persian. All classes wear a
cap made of lamb-skin. The head is
shaved, except a tuft on the top and
behind the ears. The dress of the women
is very simple. In winter, a close-bodied
robe, reaching to the knees, is
worn over a kind of vest. In summer a
loose dress of silk or muslin, loose trousers
and a vest, form the usual attire.
The head is covered with a black turban,
over which a cashmere shawl is
thrown to serve for a veil.</p>

<p>The food of the Persians is simple;
they drink the wine of the country,
which is delicious, and use a great deal
of coffee. Tobacco is smoked by all
classes. The Persians have been called
the Parisians of the East, though they
bear a nearer resemblance to the Greeks.
They are cheerful, cunning, deceitful,
and dishonest, but very social, and fond
of conversation. This abounds in complimentary
phrases, fables and apologues.
The manner of salutation is to touch
the hands, and then raise them to the
forehead. When they salute the king
or his officers, they bow thrice to the
ground.</p>

<p>The wandering tribes are found in all
parts of Persia. They are divided into
dwellers of cities, and dwellers in the
field. Many of them live in tents, which
they place on the plains during the winter,
and seek the pasture of the mountains
in the summer. They have large
flocks of cattle. They breed camels and
horses for sale, and have a large trade
in butter made of the milk of their asses.
They feed principally on their flocks,
and eat sour milk, cheese, and buttermilk.
They range at liberty, over the mountains
and plains, paying a tax to government.</p>

<p><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pageno">122</span>
There are a people in Persia called
Parsees, who worship fire, which they
make their idol. They live an honest
and pure life, subsisting upon the fruits
and productions of their lands. Many
of them, suffering persecution by the
Turks, emigrated to India, where there
are numerous communities of them.
The Arabians, who form part of the
population of Persia, gain their livelihood
by fishing and going to sea; some
of them are merchants, while others are
occupied in the planting of date trees.</p>

<p>The common advantages of education
may be obtained by all classes in Persia,
but the arts and sciences are but little
attended to. The popular literature is
comprised in poems, fables, and romantic
tales. Some of the works of their
poets are translated and much admired.</p>

<p>The religion of Persia is Mahometan,
with some slight variations in the forms
and ceremonies. There are a few
Christians. There is also a Catholic
mission, but it has made few converts.
The Persians are generally willing to
discuss the merits of different religions,
and are thus open to conviction.</p>

<p>The usages at funerals in Persia are
very peculiar. After the death and
burial of a friend, the relatives mourn
forty days, during which time, they suppose
the grave to be watched by angels.
They accordingly keep a large supply
of food upon the place of interment, for
the support of these ethereal watchers.
They must have rather earthly ideas of
the wants of angelic beings. They are
also, during the forty days of mourning,
in the constant habit of asking the deceased
person why he died!</p>

<p>The government of Persia is an absolute
despotism; the king himself cannot
change his own edicts. Sanguinary and
barbarous punishments are very common;
the eyes being sometimes put out.
Theft is punished by making a hole in a
wall, putting the offender in, and building
it up again, thus suffocating him. The
lower classes are punished by the bastinado,
or whipping the feet.</p>

<p><span class="sc">How to get Letters Free.</span>&mdash;A
shrewd countryman, being informed that
there was a letter for him in the post-office,
went accordingly for it. On the
postmaster’s handing it to him, he frankly
confessed that he could not read, and
requested the postmaster to open it, and
let him know the contents, which he
very readily did. After getting all the
information he wanted, he knowingly
shrugged up his shoulders, thanked him
for his politeness, and dryly observed&mdash;“When
I have some change I’ll call and
take it.”</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>“<span class="sc">Love one Another.</span>”&mdash;A Welsh parson,
preaching from this text, told his
congregation, that in kind and respectful
treatment to our fellow-creatures, we
were inferior to the brute creation. As
an illustration of the truth of this remark,
he quoted an instance of two goats, in
his own parish, that once met upon a
bridge so very narrow, that they could
not pass by without one thrusting the
other off into the river. “And,” continued
he, “how do you think they
acted? Why, I will tell you. One goat
lay down, and let the other leap over
him. Ah! beloved, let us live like
goats.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">I see that some little girls write to you. I
want to say something about my little cousin
Julia Ann, who lives in Petersham, Mass. I
think she does not take your Museum. I wish
she should; and my father says I may send it to
her, and as she is a <em>new</em> subscriber, you say she
may have the three bound volumes too, for
$3.00, and when she sends for them by any of
her friends, you will let her have them. Send
the numbers for 1844, by mail, to Petersham.</p>

<p class="blockquote">You write a great many stories. I wish you
would come to Georgia, and write us a good
story about the Stone Mountain, which is in the
county of Decatur, in which we live. It is a
lone, solitary rock. Father says it is eight hundred
feet high, and that there was once a wall
near the top of it. Some think the famous Spanish
adventurer, De Soto, made it a long, long
time ago. Some men built a tower on the top
of it, one hundred and sixty feet high, but it was
blown down in a storm last year. It is not a
good place to stay on the rock, for there is no
water, nor any way to get it, but by carrying
it up.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Some who have visited the Stone Mountain
say it is second to no curiosity except the Falls
of Niagara.</p>

<p>The letter which we copy below, was written
in a very neat hand, showing that the little
writer has good taste and good sense. The dollar
spoken of, must have been a sly fellow, for
when the letter came to the publishers, behold, it
was missing! We have nothing to do with the
money matters of the Museum&mdash;&#8203;that is the
affair of Bradbury &amp; Soden. But we are curious
to know something of the history of this
rogue of a dollar. Will our friend Edway let
us know whether it was a paper dollar or a real
shiner? If we can catch the fellow, we’ll write
his memoirs, and we think it will be a pleasant
story. We think the life and adventures of a
dollar that crept out of a letter one day, would
be equal to Bill Keeler’s story of the eel in the
aqueduct. If, after all, our little friend forgot
to put the dollar into the letter, he may send it
to the publishers of the Museum. This will be
satisfactory to all parties, though it may spoil a

<p>The following epistle, from a romantic, descriptive,
warm-hearted friend, was very welcome
to us, and will be so to our readers. Alas!
for those bright days when everything gives
pleasure, and even the flowers seem like things
of life! They are gone from Robert Merry forever;
but he loves to see them reflected in the
eyes of his youthful friends. We have been at
Springfield, and can testify to the accuracy of
the following description of that beautiful town.
One thing our fair correspondent has failed to
notice, and that is the cemetery, which is
scarcely inferior to Mount Auburn. Cannot
“Constant Reader” tell us something about it?
Instead of sending us the flower she promises,
she may send us her miniature. We have an
eye for things of that sort yet.</p>

<p class="sigright"><span class="corresp">Springfield, Feb. 29, 1844.</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">A long time ago, I addressed a letter to the
little readers of the Museum, and I have had it
in my mind for some time to write them another.
I told them how old Peter Parley learned me to
make pens, and how much good Robert Merry
was like him, and how very glad I was that
Peter Parley gave him all his writings before
he died. It is not probable that all of your little
friends will recollect this, but perhaps some of
them may. I was just on the point of writing
to them again, and was about to say, “Little
readers of the Museum,” when it occurred to me
that I had never written to you. So this time I
will speak to you, Mr. Merry, and tell you something
about this old town, that has been settled
for more than two hundred years; for you tell
such good stories, and talk so much like our old

<em>benefactor</em>, that I love you now almost as much
as I did him.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Springfield is my native town, so perhaps you
will not think it strange if I praise it up pretty
well. I think it the pleasantest place I have
ever seen. It lies upon the eastern side of
the beautiful, broad, majestic Connecticut river,
that comes winding down through this extensive
valley. It contains about eight thousand inhabitants,
not including Cabotville and Chickopee
Falls&mdash;&#8203;two large manufacturing villages within
the limits of Springfield. The most thickly settled
part of the town lies low upon the river’s
bank, but the handsomest portion is built upon
what is usually termed “the hill.” This elevation
commands a fine view of the lower part of
the town, and also gives a delightful view of
the river. Oh, how beautiful it looks in summer
from the brow of “the hill,” wending slowly
and sweetly its way to the sea. Upon “the hill”
is located the United States Armory, for manufacturing
muskets. The public buildings consist
of three arsenals, where many of the guns are
deposited; three long buildings, each two stories
high, where the labor is principally performed,
and another in the centre where the officers and
clerks have their offices. There are several
other smaller buildings connected with the establishment,
where various branches of the work
are perfected. Also, at what is called “<cite>the
watershops</cite>,” are a number of fine buildings
belonging to the government, where the pretty
Mill river affords a charming water privilege.</p>

<p class="blockquote">I once had a fine sail of two or three miles up
this stream. It had been a pleasant but sultry
day, and a small company of us&mdash;&#8203;merry girls
and boys&mdash;&#8203;when the sun had sunk down behind
the blue hills, filled three small boats, and while
the soft, mild moon looked into the deep, clear
water to see her face, the music of some thirty
voices blended with the still murmur of the
stream, and was echoed in the distance. Many
were the yellow water lilies we pulled into our
boats with their long stems, and many did we
leave floating gracefully with the current, their
modest heads turned gently on one side, looking
down upon the bosom of that pretty Mill river.
On that sultry summer’s evening did I almost
wish to be one of those water lilies; for Oh,
thought I, how delightful it must be, to wave so
gracefully one way and the other, constantly
laved by the cool waters&mdash;&#8203;the stars and the
moon looking down upon me in love. After
enjoying for some time the luxury which this
scene afforded, we went on shore, where was
a cool spring of water, which seemed the best
I ever drank; and close by it I found a rare
flower. If ever I should find such another, I
would send it to you, Mr. Merry, that Mr. Billings
<span class="pageno">127</span>
might take a drawing of it, so that the
<em>little readers of the Museum</em> might see it too;
for I think it was the most splendid flower I
have ever seen. We had a fine sail home, and
sung as we went, the “Canadian Boat Song,”
which many of the little girls and boys who read
the Museum are familiar with.</p>

<p class="blockquote">But now, to tell about the armory. The largest
arsenal, where the guns are deposited, is a
long brick building, three stories in height, one
hundred and twenty feet long, by forty wide. It
is a noble structure, and contains ninety-four
thousand muskets, elegantly arranged in racks,
each rack containing two thousand and forty
muskets. From the upper story of this building,
we have a line view of the Connecticut, and
in the summer we often see from this place
many boats gaily passing up and down the
river.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Does it not seem a pity, Mr. Merry, that so
peaceful a spot as that on which this armory is
located, should be devoted to these implements
of death? Is it not time that they were changed
into “ploughshares and pruning-hooks,” as the
Bible tells us all these war instruments will be,
some time or other?</p>

<p class="blockquote">A year or two since, two old barracks were
standing on the ground belonging to the United
States, that some thirty-five or forty years ago,
sheltered several hundred soldiers. They are
now torn down, but often, as I used to pass them,
I thought how happy Peter Parley would be to
sit down in one of these old buildings, and tell
us children long stories about the war and the
Indians. I often thought how glad I should be
to run and bring a chair for him, on which to
rest his gouty toe. From the spot where stood
these old buildings, may be seen Mount Tom,
some eighteen miles distant, holding up his tall
blue head. I love to look at him, for there is
always something very pleasing to me in the
sight of a noble mountain; it makes one’s heart
<em>feel large</em>, and seems silently to teach the eye
to look upward to Him who created all things.
I have sometimes imagined Mount Tom to be
the highest peak of the Alps, and when a dense
fog has covered its top, I have fancied it to be
all clothed with perpetual snow; for I sometimes
enjoy very much a flight of the imagination. I
think I must have learned this of old Peter Parley.
Oh, how many pretty stories has he told us about
Mount Tom, and Mount Holyoke, and the Connecticut,
as it passes through these mountains,
and about Bellows Falls and the Indians catching
fish with long spears.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The western rail-road passes through this
town. A bridge has been built across the Connecticut,
which passenger trains cross four times
during the day, and freight trains twice. This
bridge is firmly supported by six granite piers,
of uncommon beauty and almost invincible
strength, which have hitherto, and probably ever
will, bid defiance to the large fields of ice that
come floating down the river in the spring; and
when passing it the cars may be heard for miles.
This noble specimen of architecture was designed
and executed by the enterprising and ingenious
William Howe; and, taking it as a whole, is a
very perfect work of art, and the admiration of
all who see it.</p>

<p class="blockquote">We have seven churches in town, the largest
of which is the first Congregational Church. It
stands near the Court House, in front of which
is a fine square in which stands a fountain built
of marble, and many beautiful trees, and among
them a number of majestic elms that are an
ornament to the whole town. A tree standing
near the fountain now presents a most magnificent
appearance. The water flowing from the
fountain has congealed upon it until it now looks
like a huge monument of marble, chiseled out
by some master hand. The branches of this
tree, and the monument itself, are hung with
large, transparent icicles of the most exquisite
beauty. I hope, Mr. Merry, you will sometime
give your little friends a view of this square, for
I think they would be delighted to see it. Under
the shade of these tall trees, gathers the <em>Cold
Water Army</em>, on the 4th of July, to receive the
spray from the fountain, and to drink of the cool
water that comes gushing up and gracefully
falls into its marble basin; after which they
march in long procession, with gay banners,
smiling faces, and happy hearts, to a most interesting
place called Worthington Grove, where
long tables are spread with all kinds of refreshments,
and decorated with flowers and evergreens.
Here, sheltered by stately oaks and
canopied by heaven, we listen to interesting
speeches; fill the large, tall grove with merry
songs; send upward wild shouts of “Hurrah for
cold water!!” and then, gathering about the
tables, satisfy our appetites, and quench our
thirst by water from the spring; and if now and
then a dash of <em>rain</em> comes down upon us, we
only sing and laugh the louder, and give still
heartier cheers for <em>cold water</em>!!</p>

<p class="blockquote">There are two banks here in town; notwithstanding
money is rather scarce. However, I
think we do pretty well by you, Mr. Merry, if
we do not abound in <em>cash</em>; for of late many have
subscribed for your nice Museum. But I cannot
write any more just now, though there is
still enough to tell about this good town of
Springfield. Let me say, before I am quite
done, that we should be very happy, exceedingly
happy, to see you here, Mr. Merry; and
though the cannons might not fire a salute,
<span class="pageno">128</span>
most sure I am that you would meet a <em>happy</em>
greeting.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="sc">Mr. Merry</span>:</p>

<p class="blockquote">Dear Sir,&mdash;&#8203;In the last number of the Museum,
you say that in England, February has nearly
the same character as our March, and is regarded
as the opening of spring. Will you
please tell me, in the next number, why England
or London should have an earlier spring
than New York&mdash;&#8203;being ten degrees north of
New York?&mdash;and oblige your subscriber,</p>

<p class="sigright"><span class="sc">William</span>.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><cite>Answer.</cite></p>

<p>In reply to the preceding inquiry, we must
first remark, that the curious fact mentioned by
William, has been variously explained. Our
theory upon the subject is this. Greenland, a
vast island at the northern point of our continent,
is a mighty ice-house, perhaps as extensive
as the whole United States. Here the ice
and snow are piled up from century to century,
imparting to all the regions around something
of its own chilly atmosphere. The northerly
winds that come even to us have something of
old Greenland’s breath in them.</p>

<p>For this reason, as we think, all the northern
portions of North America are much colder than
they would otherwise be.</p>

<p>If our correspondent, William, will look at a
map of the eastern continent, he will see that
the Arctic Ocean occupies the whole space to
the north of about seventy-two degrees of latitude.
There is no Greenland there&mdash;&#8203;no great
mass of land to hoard up the ice and snow from
age to age, and furnish an everlasting ice-house
to scatter abroad its freezing influences. To
the north of the eastern continent, there is ever
an open, unfrozen sea, tending rather to abate
than increase the cold.</p>

<p>These simple facts will show one great reason
why our continent should be colder than the eastern
continent, and will serve in part to answer
William’s inquiry. There are other curious
facts in relation to this subject, which have their
bearing upon the question, but we have hardly
time to state them now. We will only add, that
the western coast of the American continent has
a much milder climate than the eastern. At
Astoria, which is in latitude about forty-seven
degrees, it is as mild as at Philadelphia, which
is at about forty degrees. The same is the fact
in relation to the eastern continent; at the southern
point of Kamschatka, which is about the
latitude of London, it is almost as cold and tempestuous
as at Greenland. Various causes have
been assigned for these remarkable facts, but
we cannot notice them now.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>One of our little friends seems to be suspicious
that the letters we insert are invented and
written by Robert Merry himself, and not by
the young persons from whom they seem to
come. This being the first of April, we might
be excused for putting off a pleasant joke upon
our readers, but it would be dishonest in us to
take the credit due to others. The letters inserted
are the genuine productions of the various
correspondents whose signatures they bear.
Every mail brings us some of these epistles, and
at the end of the month, we have quite a flock
of them&mdash;&#8203;welcome as blue-birds in March.
Good bye, till the first of May.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We have a sad story to tell, at the close of
this month’s Museum. Mr. Samuel S. Soden,
one of the original publishers of this magazine,
and one who was largely instrumental in establishing
it, died at his native place&mdash;&#8203;Saxonville,
in this State&mdash;&#8203;on the 20th of the present month,
aged 25 years. He was a man of very pleasant
manners, active habits, and zealous devotion
to any cause which he espoused. He
took hold of Merry’s Museum with great ardor,
and much of its success is to be credited to his
efforts at the outset of the undertaking. His
disease was a lingering consumption, which he
bore with great patience and even cheerfulness.
We hope our young readers will bestow upon
his memory a kind thought, as one who has
contributed to their pleasure&mdash;&#8203;and, may we not
add, to their profit?</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Inquisitive Jack.</h3>

<p class="p2 center ls">CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="center"><cite>About birds in general.</cite></p>

<p>Our friend Jack, having made himself
familiar with the peculiarities of the
domestic fowls, turned his attention
to other species of birds. He noticed
particularly those which seemed to
possess gentle and confiding natures,
such as the sparrows that build upon the
shrubs round the house; the martens
that take up their abode in boxes which
you make for them, and place near the
eaves of your dwelling; the swallows
that build in the barn, and the cheerful
robin that loves to dwell in the apple orchard.
All these he observed with care,
noticing their modes of building and rearing
their young; the food they eat, the
cries they uttered, and, in general, their
peculiar characteristics.</p>

<p>From these, Jack passed to other
birds, and carefully studied them also.
At last, he was pretty well acquainted
with the whole subject of birds; and now
he observed several important things,
which I shall present to the attention of
my readers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i047.jpg"
 width="50%"
 alt="Quill"
 />
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>In the first place, Jack was struck
with admiration at the formation of
birds. They are designed to raise themselves
in the air, and to spend a considerable
part of their time in that subtle
element. And how wonderfully adapted
to this purpose are they! In the first
place, a bird must have great strength,
and yet great lightness: and how happily
are they united! Look at the quill
of the wing&mdash;&#8203;how strong, and yet how
light! Who could have invented anything
more admirably suited to rise on
the breeze and cut its way through the
air? Is there a human being who could
make a single quill, even if the model
were placed before him? Not one.</p>

<p><span class="pageno">131</span>
And then look at the bones of the bird.
These, instead of being heavy as in quadrupeds,
are all hollow. They are therefore
a great deal lighter than those of
other animals, while they are equally
strong. And then, observe the structure
of the bird’s skeleton. What a wonderful
and ingenious piece of machinery!
Look at the wing: how easily it opens
and shuts, and thus at once lifts the bird
upward, and drives it forward like an
arrow in its path. Look at the tail&mdash;&#8203;destined,
like the rudder of a ship, to direct
its course&mdash;&#8203;and how admirably it
is turned this way and that, quick as
thought, to guide the aerial voyager
even among the intricacies of the forest!</p>

<p>Consider the feathery covering of the
bird, designed to present a smooth surface,
so as not to cause interruption in
passing through the air, and to furnish a
coat as impervious to the water as India
rubber, yet light as the gossamer. How
wonderfully are these objects attained!
And now let us reflect upon the wisdom
of the Creator, in designing a class of
animals destined to soar aloft upon the
air, and His power in accomplishing His
purposes, as evinced in the structure of
birds. How many millions of these
beautiful creatures there are in the
world! how diversified their structure,
habits and instincts! and yet, let it be
remembered that man, with all his art,
cannot make a feather.</p>

<p>The music of birds is a very curious
and interesting phenomenon, not only
on account of the admirable variety and
sweetness of the songs they produce, but
for the strength of their voices. The
lowing of the bull, or the roaring of the
lion, cannot be heard at a great distance,
yet the little thrush can be heard half a
mile. If quadrupeds had voices equal
to those of birds, in proportion to their
size, an elephant could easily be heard
across the Atlantic ocean.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

 alt="Spoonbill"

 <p class="center caption">Spoonbill.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The variety in the forms of birds is a
subject of great interest. How different
is the duck, with its short legs, from the
spoonbill, which seems to be walking upon
stilts; the common barn-door fowl, with
its short neck, from the flamingo, whose
neck is almost a yard in length, and not
half as thick as your wrist! How different
is an ostrich, which will carry a
boy upon its back, from the little humming-bird,
which seems scarcely larger
than a humble-bee!</p>

<p>Who can look forth upon the landscape,
and notice the feathered tribes,
glancing from tree to tree, and from bush
to bush, delighting the eye with their
<span class="pageno">132</span>
pleasing forms and lovely hues, and the
ear with their charming melody, and
the heart with that aspect of life and
cheerfulness, which they throw over the
meadow, forest and field, and not lift up
his thoughts to heaven and say, “Oh
Lord, how manifold are thy works&mdash;&#8203;in
goodness and mercy hast thou made
them all!”</p>

 <p class ="center caption">Ostriches.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>But I must not forget to say one thing
more about Jack in this chapter. While
he was studying the subject of birds, he
was very fond of getting young ones, so
that he might rear them; he also caught
several old ones, which he kept in cages.
Now I believe that certain birds may be
happy in cages, such as canaries, and many
others, that are bred in confinement;
but to catch wild birds and shut them
up, is treating the poor little creatures
very cruelly. I would not, therefore, be
thought to commend Jack’s example in
this respect.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<h3 class="h3head">The Deserts of Africa and Asia.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">I<span class="sc">n</span> Africa, as well as Asia, there are
immense tracts of land called deserts,
which consist of vast plains composed
of loose sand. Large portions of these
are utterly destitute of vegetation, and
sometimes, in crossing them, the traveller
sees not a hill, or mountain, or human
dwelling, or even a tree or shrub,
or blade of grass. All around is a sea
of sand, and far as the eye can reach, it
is one scene of lifeless solitude and desolation.</p>

<p>These trackless wastes are traversed
by caravans, which are companies of
travellers usually mounted upon camels.
Horses travel in these sands with difficulty.
Their feet sink in the soil; they
are overcome with heat, and parched
with drought. The camel, on the contrary,
has a large spongy foot, which
does not sink in the sand; he can bear
excessive heat, and by a curious contrivance
of nature, is enabled to go without
water for five or six days. This valuable
creature is called the ship of the
desert, because it enables the merchants
of Asia and Africa to transport their
merchandise over the sea of sand, just
as a ship carries goods from one part of
the world to another, across the briny
ocean. It seems really as if Providence
had provided this singular animal on
purpose to enable mankind to traverse
the great deserts which are spread out
upon the eastern continent.</p>

<p>The desert of Sahara stretches nearly
from the eastern to the western coast of
Africa, a distance of almost three thousand
miles. Its width is about eight
hundred miles. Its whole extent is
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pageno">134</span>
nearly equal to that of the United
States. This vast region, though for
the most part a scene of absolute desolation,
has a few spots where the water
collects in pools, around which some
vegetation springs up. These places,
which bear a delightful contrast to the
surrounding sterility, and cheer the eye
of the thirsty, weary traveller, are called
<dfn>oases</dfn>. Here the caravans quench their
thirst and repose in the delicious shadow
of the trees. The deserts of Arabia are
far less extensive, but they are of a similar
character to that of Sahara.</p>

<p>It might seem that these inhospitable
regions would be deserted by man; but
they are not only crossed by companies
of travellers who wish to pass from one
country to another, but by bands of wandering
Arabs, who spend their whole
lives upon these deserts. These are, for
the most part, desperate robbers. Thus,
the lonely desert has its pirates, as well
as the lonely sea. These thieves have
not only swift camels, but swift horses;
and it is amazing to see how rapidly they
will speed over the sandy plains. They
come upon the traveller almost as suddenly
as the hawk that descends from
the sky upon its unsuspecting prey, and
they disappear almost as suddenly.</p>

<p>It might seem that these inhabitants
of the desert would lead a miserable life,
and especially that they would often be
swallowed up in the terrific sand storms,
which sometimes sweep over these
wastes. The sand, being loose and dry,
is borne upward by the whirling tempest,
and is seen driving over the plain,
like a terrific thunder-cloud. The experienced
traveller sees the coming danger,
and prepares himself for it. He
throws himself upon the ground, and
covers his face so as not to be choked
with the dust. The horses and camels,
guided by instinct, also put their noses to
the earth to prevent being suffocated. If
the storm is slight, the party escapes; but
sometimes, such immense waves of sand
are drifted upon the wind, as to bury the
traveller so deeply beneath it, as to make
it his winding-sheet forever. Sometimes
whole caravans, with their horses and
camels, have been in this manner overwhelmed&mdash;&#8203;thus
making the waves of the
desert as fatal as the waves of the sea.</p>

<p>Yet, despite the terrors of the desert,
the Arabs are a lively and cheerful race.
On their march, they stop at night; and
in their tents, spread beneath the starry
canopy, the laugh, the jest and the song
go round. There are among them professed
story-tellers, who delight the listeners
with fanciful tales of enchantment,
adventure, and love, or perhaps they repeat,
in an animated manner, some fine
specimens of Arabic poetry. Thus it is,
that mankind, occupying the gloomiest
parts of the earth, have amusements.
As the steel is made to yield its spark,
so the Arab finds pleasure in the
desert.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Merry Knight.</span>&mdash;When Sir
Henry Marshal, knight and alderman of
London, received the honor of knighthood
from George II., he fell flat upon
the floor. The king was surprised, but
on the knight rising up, he facetiously
said,&mdash;&#8203;“Your majesty has conferred so
much honor upon me, that I was not
able to stand up under it.” His majesty
ever after called him the merry knight.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Dick Boldhero.</h3>

<p class="p2 center ls">CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="center"><cite>Various plantations&mdash;&#8203;droll and dangerous adventures.</cite></p>

<p class="p2 dropcap negindent">A<span class="sc">s</span> I pursued my journey along the
banks of the Surinam, I met with
frequent plantations of coffee, sugar-cane,
cotton and cacao.</p>

<p>The sugar plantations, at a little distance,
bear some resemblance to our
fields of Indian corn. The cane has a
broad, long leaf, with a jointed stalk or
stem. This grows to the height of seven
or eight feet, and is very smooth and
glossy. The sugar-cane is not propagated
by seeds, but by cuttings from the
root end of the stalk, which are planted
in rows or hills. It puts forth large
silky tassels, which have a beautiful appearance.
In eighteen months from the
time of planting, it is fit to cut; the
stalks are put into a mill, and from the
juice that is crushed out, sugar and molasses
are made.</p>

<p>The labor of Guiana is almost wholly
performed by negroes. During the period
when they are making sugar, they
live almost wholly upon the juice of the
<span class="pageno">136</span>
cane, and at that time, they are said to
get very fat. The laboring horses, oxen
and mules, though kept constantly at
work, being allowed to eat refuse stalks,
and scummings from the boiling-house,
thrive in the most surprising manner.</p>

<p>The cacao trees bear the fruit of
which chocolate is made. These resemble
young cherry-trees, but separate
near the ground into four or five stems.
The leaves are about four inches long,
smooth, but not glossy, and of a dull
green color. The flowers are saffron-colored,
and very beautiful. The fruit
somewhat resembles a cucumber in
shape. Its color, while growing, is
green; but as it ripens, this changes
to a fine bluish red, with pink veins.</p>

<p>Each of the pods contains from twenty
to thirty nuts or kernels, which resemble
almonds, and consist of a white
and sweet pulpy substance, enveloped in
a parchment-like shell. These are the
cacao or chocolate nuts. When the
fruit is ripe, it is gathered, and the nuts
are taken from the pods, and laid on
leaves or skins to dry. They are then
put into bags, each containing about a
hundred weight, and thus packed, are
exported to foreign countries.</p>

<p>I noticed, as I went along, a few fields
of Indian corn and rice, and I was informed
that two crops of these are frequently
obtained in a season. I observed
the castor-oil plant, growing wild, as
well as the cabbage-tree, which is a kind
of palm. This derives its name, not
from its appearance, but from the use to
which it is put by the inhabitants. The
leaves grow crowded together at the top
of the stem, and when these are cut off,
the central ones are found to be white
and tender, and when boiled, they are
used as a substitute for cabbage.</p>

<p>I occasionally met with small patches
of the indigo plant. This is cultivated
by seeds, which are sown in rows, about
a foot apart. In three months the top
part is cut off, leaving the roots to shoot
up anew. I used to suppose that indigo
was a kind of mineral, but I now learned
that it was made from these small plants.
The tops of the herbs being cut, as I
have mentioned, are steeped in vats.
They are then pounded and put in
water. The coloring matter, consisting
of a fine powder, forms a sediment,
which is cut into small pieces about an
inch square, before it is perfectly dry.
It is then packed in barrels, or sewed up
in sacks for sale. The process of making
indigo is very curious, and one
thing is strange: the plant itself is
harmless, but the indigo drug is a deadly
poison.</p>

<p>Although I had frequently a lonely
sort of feeling, as I pursued my way, and
sometimes wished that I was snug at
home with my mother and sister, I still
found it, on the whole, very pleasant to
travel in this strange land, and picked
up a good deal of information, and saw
many things that were quite rare and
wonderful to me. I was constantly impressed
with the strangeness of everything
around me. Instead of forests of
chestnut, walnut, and maple trees, so
common in Connecticut, I here saw forests
of gigantic mahogany, live oak, and
other curious trees, the names of which
I could not learn.</p>

<p>The birds, too, were all different from
those to which I had been accustomed.
The woods were all alive with flocks of
<span class="pageno">137</span>
green parrots and red macaws, which
kept up a constant chatting. The latter
seemed perpetually scolding each other,
and I could sometimes fancy that they
were calling each other all the hard
names they could think of. I saw a
great many toucans, with bills half as
long as their bodies; they kept bowing
their heads and making a kind of motion,
like a minister in the pulpit.
Hence, the people call this bird the
preacher.</p>

<p>I saw a great many other birds, most
of which were adorned with magnificent
plumage; but they had harsh
voices, and were all very unlike my
feathered acquaintances in the “land of
steady habits.” I once met with a woodpecker,
which resembled the red-headed
thief, who spears so many of our cherries
with his long bill. He nodded his
head, and uttered a sort of cry, which
reminded me so strongly of home, that
the tears filled my eyes, and I paused
and partly turned about, for the purpose
of returning. But this weakness
was transient, and I soon pursued my
way.</p>

<p>My path now turned from the river,
and wound through a thick forest. It
was no longer a wagon-road, but a mere
mule-track. The weather continued
very hot, and I suffered excessively from
the bite of large gnats, three times as big
as our musquitoes. At first, I was half
crazy from the sting of these insects;
but by degrees I became hardened, and
at last took it very quietly, even if one
of these impertinent rogues thrust his
little poisoned javelin into the point of
my nose. At night I slept soundly, although
these fellows feasted upon me
from the crown of my head to the tips
of my toes.</p>

<p>The forests through which I was proceeding
grew more and more dense as I
advanced; many of the trees rose to an
immense height, and festoons of gray
moss swung from tree to tree, as if they
had been decorated by the hand of art.
Vines, with green leaves and gaudy
flowers, wreathed the trunks of the trees,
and parasitical plants, with blossoms
bright as gems, and of every color and
form, wound around their branches.
Nothing could surpass the gorgeous
splendor of the scene. It appeared as
if nature, in a sportive and fantastic
mood, had put forth every effort here to
combine the beautiful and the magnificent,
in the vegetable kingdom. And
as if to captivate every sense, the air
was balmy, and the sweetest fragrance
was borne on the gentle breezes that
stole from the forest.</p>

<p>I was so much occupied with noticing
the curiosities that met me on every
hand, that I did not observe, till the sun
was setting, that my path had now
shrunk into little more than a deer-track,
and began to suspect that I had missed
my way; and this impression was
strengthened by the fact that I did not
reach a negro settlement, where I had
expected to spend the night. I hesitated,
for a few moments, whether to proceed
or turn back. Resolving upon the former,
I pushed on with rapid strides.
My path, however, grew more and more
undefined, and at last I was completely
lost in a bewildering maze. It was now
sunset, and the shadows of night had
begun to thicken around me. I attempted
to retrace my steps, but could not recover
<span class="pageno">138</span>
the path. Finding it hopeless to
attempt to extricate myself, I concluded
to pass the night where I was.</p>

<p>My situation was not a pleasant one.
I knew that these forests were the abodes
of wild animals, who shrunk from daylight,
yet prowled forth at night without
fear or restraint. But courage is apt to
come with necessity; and seeing that
there was no help at hand, I sat down,
clenched my cudgel, and determined to
keep watch till morning. I remained in
this condition for some time, listening to
the strange sounds that began to steal
upon the ear as the evening advanced.
The day birds had gone to their repose,
and their various cries had gradually
faded into silence. But voices of a different
kind now saluted me. Reptiles
of many kinds began their uncouth
songs, and droned away for hours together.
Birds, known only to these solitudes,
and which, even here, were silent
during the day, now poured out their
music without fear. Never did I hear
such a jargon as seemed for a time to
fill the woods around me. I could easily
fancy that strange and unearthly spirits
filled the air, and were trying to see
what a variety of uncouth songs they
could produce.</p>

<p>I listened to these notes for a long
time, with a degree of painful excitement.
It seemed to me that a thousand
voices had united in one wild chorus, as
if to drive me mad. I stopped my ears
to keep out the din: I closed my eyes to
withdraw my attention from the scene
around me. At last, the sounds began
to subside, and darkness gradually gave
way, and I saw the moonbeams tinging
the tops of the trees. Silence stole over
the scene, and I fell into a profound repose.
My imagination wandered to the
scenes of my childhood. I was once
more, as I dreamed, with my mother
and my sister. They embraced me with
rapture, and tears of bliss fell upon my
cheeks. I remained with them for days,
and a tranquil joy filled my bosom. We
went to church, and once more I heard
the sacred hymn, and the soothing, solemn
tunes, which had become associated
with all my religious emotions.</p>

<p>The psalm was ended, and the preacher
began his discourse. He seemed at
first a grave and reverend divine, holding
before him a ponderous volume, containing
the sacred Scriptures. But suddenly
he seemed to change: his voice grew
harsh and shrieking; his gestures became
wild and fantastic, and at last he uttered
a hideous yell, and jumping out of his
pulpit, fell with a terrible crash upon the
two deacons who sat beneath. Startled
and terrified, I suddenly awoke; but
the scene which now arrested my attention,
was even more extraordinary than
that which had been presented in my
dream.</p>

<p>At a little distance, was an open glade,
upon which the moonlight now fell with
a dazzling splendor. In the centre of
this spot there sat at least a hundred figures,
which seemed to me to be men and
women, about half the size of life. Upon
a branch of a tree, which projected over
them, was another figure, who seemed
to be addressing the assembly. He uttered
the most extraordinary sounds, and
appeared to be speaking in a very animated
manner. His gestures were
strong, quick, and emphatic. Sometimes
he sat upon his haunches, and sometimes
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pageno">139</span>
he stood upright. Occasionally he leaped
from one branch of the tree to another,
and at times he swung off from his seat,
and suspended himself by his tail. This
last performance led me to conclude that
if this was a congregation of human beings,
they must be of rather a queer species.</p>

<p>I sat still, and for a long time observed
the scene. Nothing could exceed the
seeming eloquence of the preacher, except
the sympathy and sensibility of the
audience. They appeared to feel every
tone and gesture, and responded by sympathetic
grunts, groans, yells, and every
possible variety of attitude and gesticulation.
At last, the orator, having uttered
a tremendous burst of eloquence,
leaped from his rostrum, and came with
a bound into the midst of the congregation.
Upon this, they all set up a shout,
which echoed far and wide over the
scene.</p>

<p>I had become so interested in this
spectacle, that I had risen from my resting-place,
and advanced so far as to be
near the actors in this curious drama.
One of them now chanced to spy me;
upon which he uttered a terrific yell.
The eyes of the whole assembly were
turned upon me, and, uttering a frightful
howl, they all set out, and came bounding
toward me. Never in my life have I been
placed in a situation at once so ludicrous
and so appalling. A hundred monkeys
now surrounded me; some mounting the
trees over my head, and some winding
among the bushes at my feet; some
howling, and all grinning at me, and
making the most threatening demonstrations.</p>

as it was, he behaved with considerable
propriety. He spoke to his neighbors, as
he met them, much as before, and when
he could get from under his wife’s supervision,
he would stop and chat familiarly
with old intimates. He demeaned himself
modestly, and seemed little elated

and ready to befriend the needy;
but still, he had many sources of vexation.</p>

<p>His restless helpmate insisted that he
should dress “as became his station;”
and accordingly he was compelled to
wear tight shoes, which pinched his
corns terribly, and kept him in an almost
constant state of martyrdom. When he
walked abroad, he put his foot to the
ground as gingerly as if he were stepping
<span class="pageno">140</span>
on eggs. He was required to have
his coat in the fashion, which trussed
him up about the arms, and made those
limbs stand out upon each side of him,
like a couple of pump-handles. His
neckcloth, of pure white, (as was the fashion
then,) was lined with what was called
a pudding; and to please his dame, who
had a nice taste in these matters, he tied
it so tight that it threw the blood into
his face, and gave his ruddy complexion
a liver-colored hue.</p>

<p>Nor was this all poor Tom had to endure.
He was constantly “hatchelled”
as to his manners, somewhat after the
following fashion: “My dear Trudge,”
his wife would say to him, “do now try
to be a gentleman. Pray wipe your
nose with your pocket handkerchief, and
not with your fingers! Turn your toes
out, man, or people will never forget that
you was once a pedler. Hold your
head up, step large, swing your arms
bravely, and seem to be somebody. In
short, pray do be genteel.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, wife,” Trudge would reply;
“I’ll do as well as I can.” The
dialogue would usually go on pretty
much as follows.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. T.</span> Do as well as you can! and
is that all you have to say for yourself?
Oh, dear, dear! I’m afraid I shall never
make nothin’ on you. One can’t make
a silk purse of a sow’s ear, as Shakspeare
says. Oh, Tom, Tom, I wish
you had a little more <em>jinnysyquaw</em>!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tom.</span> Jinnysyquaw! What the mischief’s
that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. T.</span> Just as if you didn’t know
what jinnysyquaw was! Oh, my dear
Tom! you are as ignorant as the whipping-post.
Not know what jinnysyquaw
is! Oh, dear, dear! This comes of
not knowing French. Why, jinnysyquaw
is a&mdash;&#8203;a&mdash;&#8203;a kind of something-or-other&mdash;&#8203;that&mdash;&#8203;nobody
knows nothing
about&mdash;&#8203;that is to say&mdash;&#8203;it is a kind of
can’t-tell-ish-ness. For instance, if a person
has a very genteel air, they say,
“<cite>He’s got the true jinnysyquaw.</cite>” All
the people who have been to Paris talk a
great deal about it; and I’ll tell you as a
secret, Tom&mdash;&#8203;Dick Flint whispered in
my ear, the other night at Mrs. Million’s
party, and he told me I had the real
French jinnysyquaw! Now, what do
you think of that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tom.</span> What do I think of it! I think
he’s an impudent jackanapes, and you
are a--!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. T.</span> Hold your tongue, Tom&mdash;&#8203;hold
your tongue! Dick Flint’s the
height of fashion: everybody is running
after him. He’s been abroad, sir&mdash;&#8203;yes,
he’s been abroad, sir! That’s more
than you can say for yourself. So, hold
your tongue, and listen to me. Try to
be a gentleman, as becomes your station.
Hold up your head, carry a stiff upper
lip, and keep up an important air. There
should always be about a person of consequence,
something which says, “Clear
the road, for <em>I</em> am coming.”</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tom.</span> I suppose you mean the jinnysyquaw.</p>

<p>This last observation was made by
Tom with a quizzical look, as if he was
poking fun at his spouse. But she took
it in good part, for she was too well satisfied
with herself to suspect that she
could be the object of ridicule.</p>

<p>We have thus given some idea of certain
vexations which marred the happiness
of Squire Trudge. Nor was this
<span class="pageno">141</span>
the only evil of his lot. Though he had
a sort of impression that he was so rich
as to justify any degree of extravagance,
yet he was sometimes disturbed by the
sums of money which his ambitious wife
lavished upon her follies.</p>

<p>Nor was that lady wholly without her
annoyances, however she might seem to
be floating upon a sea of bliss. She
could not but feel the superiority of Mrs.
Million, who was a woman of talent and
education, and the only mode she had to
supply her own deficiency, was to excel
her rival in dash and splendor. Accordingly,
she had fine horses and a splendid
carriage. She gave parties, at
which there was always an abundant
feast. She appeared in the most costly
dresses, and carried every fashion to its
height.</p>

<p>While she affected to despise and hate
Mrs. Million, she imitated her in everything.
At last, she became so complete
a caricature of that fashionable dame,
that everybody discovered the ridiculous
resemblance. Mrs. Million, far from being
flattered by seeing such a grotesque
reflection of herself, was infinitely more
vexed at the involuntary homage thus
rendered by Bridget, than she could
have been by her envy and spleen.</p>

<p>A new fancy now crept into the brain
of our heroine. Mrs. Million had just
got a piano from New York, and, as it
was the only one in the town, and a
great rarity in those days, it excited
quite a sensation among the fashionable
circles of Buckwheat. Perceiving this,
and determined to be behind in nothing,
Bridget resolved to get one, and a much
more splendid one than Mrs. Million’s.
Accordingly, the following conversation
ensued between herself and Tom the
next morning.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. T.</span> My dear Mr. Trudge, I
wish you had been at Mrs. Million’s
last night. She’s got the beautifullest
<em>pianny</em> in her parlor that you ever see.
Now I want you to send to New York
for one for me, and I want to have the
beautifullest that can be got.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tom.</span> What’s the use of sending to
New York? Can’t you get one here?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. T.</span> Get one here, indeed! not a
bit of it. Beside, nothing will do but
one all the way from New York.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tom.</span> Well, well! I’ll see about it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. T.</span> Well, let it be here on
Thursday, for my <em>sorry</em>&mdash;that’s a good
man!</p>

<p>Here the conversation ended, and, on
the appointed day, a huge tub, set on
wheels, and painted green, was brought
from New York, and trundled into the
front entry of the Trudges. The tub
contained a splendid group of <em>peonies</em>, in
full bloom.</p>

<p>“What <em>have</em> you got there?” said
Mrs. Trudge to her husband, who was
standing by. “Why, the <em>pianny</em>, to be
sure,” says Tom. “The pianny!” said
his wife, throwing up her hands; “the
pianny! What a ridiculous blunder!
Oh, Tom, Tom, you’ll break my heart!
You’ve no more hedication than a
heath-hen. I axed you to get me a pianny,
and you have got me a pianny.”</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Trudge sobbed aloud, and
it was a long time before poor Mr.
Trudge could be made to understand
the mistake he had made. He was at
last compelled to order the piano, even
though it cost four hundred dollars, and
he considered the peace with his wife,
<span class="pageno">142</span>
which he thus purchased, to have been
cheaply obtained.</p>

<p>Another vexation which Mrs. Trudge
experienced, arose from her servants.
Sometimes she was familiar, sometimes
imperious and tyrannical. She therefore
secured neither the respect nor affection
of those around her. She was
accordingly accustomed to indulge in
the fashionable outcry against her
“<em>help</em>.”</p>

<p>An incident which throws some light
upon this topic, it may be worth while
to relate. Mrs. Million had recently
introduced bells into her house, and
Bridget followed suit. The servants
conceived a dislike to being thus summoned
into the presence of their mistress.
It struck them not only as an innovation,
but as a rude and harsh mode of calling
them. Mrs. Trudge’s manner was not
calculated to allay this aversion, for
while the bells were being put up, she
seemed to assume a loftier tone than
usual.</p>

<p>When they were at last arranged, she
attired herself in a splendid satin dress,
took a bottle of hartshorn, reclined luxuriously
upon a sofa, and then pulled the
bell-rope, which was near. She waited
a little, but no one came at the summons.
She pulled again, but there was
no answer. At last, she gave the cord
an imperious twitch, which nearly sundered
the wires. In a few seconds, the
chambermaid popped her head in at the
door, and said spitefully to her mistress,
“You may pull and pull till you are
gray, Miss Trudge; the more you ring,
the more I won’t come.”</p>

<p>Such were some of the vexations
which disturbed the brilliant career of
our heroine. There were others, also,
and even those of a more serious character.
But she still pressed forward in
her course of ambition. She seemed
indeed to be always in a flurry, and to
keep everybody around her in a constant
state of uneasy excitement. She
was indeed never happy for a moment,
and seemed ever to be tormented with the
desire of chasing a phantom she could
never obtain. If, indeed, she had any
enjoyments, they consisted only of the
fleeting pleasures which characterize little
minds&mdash;&#8203;the idea that she was exciting
the envy and admiration of those
around her.</p>

<p>Thus affairs proceeded for several
years, but, at last, a crisis came. The
extravagance of the family not only exhausted
the whole of Trudge’s fortune,
but ran him in debt. His creditors came
upon him, and as he could not meet
their demands, he was declared a bankrupt.
The event found Mrs. Trudge
upon the full tide of fashionable dissipation.
She was struck like a bird in
mid flight. She could not, and would
not at first, believe the melancholy tidings.
It was, alas! too true, and she
was compelled to submit to her cruel
fate.</p>

<p>With scarcely a shilling in his pocket,
and only a few necessary articles of furniture
which his creditors had allowed
him, poor Tom set out with his wife and
children to return to the little brown
dwelling, which he had occupied before
his drawing the prize. They were
obliged to go on foot, and as Bridget proceeded
down the nicely-gravelled walk,
thus taking leave of her splendid mansion
forever, she felt a keener pang than
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pageno">143</span>
can be well uttered in words. She was
indeed the very image of despair. Her
pride was humbled&mdash;&#8203;her prospects blighted&mdash;&#8203;her
heart broken. Tom led the way,
and though he felt for his wife and children,
there was a remarkable aspect of
cheerfulness in his countenance.</p>

<p>The party at length arrived at their
dwelling. It seemed so desolate and bare,
that for two or three days Bridget seemed
utterly crushed. Tom treated her with
great tenderness, and, at the same time,
kept up a cheerful air. In a few days,
Bridget’s good sense and energy of character
prevailed. She entered upon her
duties, and before a fortnight had passed,
she seemed not only resigned to her fate,
but absolutely content. Tom whistled,
and danced, and said that he was ten
times happier than when he lived in the
great house. He could now wear an
easy old coat, and shoes that did not
pinch his corns. Beside, he had been
weary of the idle life he had led, and he
now entered upon his old trade as a pedler,
with pleasure and alacrity. The
children soon became accustomed to the
change, and, in less than three months
after their downfall, Tom and his wife
both agreed that they were happier in
their brown house than they ever had
been in the big mansion.</p>

<p>“Style and splendor may do for those
who are brought up to it,” said Tom;
“but, after all, the comfort and content
of the cottage are much better. Don’t
you think so, Bridget?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Tom, I do indeed,” said the
spouse.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tom.</span> It’s almost equal to the <em>jinnysyquaw</em>,
an’t it, Bridget?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. T.</span> Hold your tongue, Tom!</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p><span class="sc">Anecdote of a Tiger.</span>&mdash;One day a singular
circumstance took place in a menagerie
near London, which shows the
retentive memory of the tiger. A sailor,
who had been strolling round the exhibition,
loitering here and there to admire the
animals, was attracted by a strange noise,
made by a tiger, who seemed irritated beyond
endurance. Jack, somewhat alarmed,
sought the keeper to inquire the cause
of so singular a display of feeling, which,
he remarked, became more boisterous, the
nearer he approached the animal. The
keeper replied, that the behavior of the
tiger indicated that he was either vastly
pleased, or very much annoyed. Upon
this, the sailor again approached the den,
and gazed at the tiger a few minutes,
during which time the animal became
frantic with seeming rage, lashing his
tail against his sides, and giving utterance
to the most frightful bellowings. He
soon discovered the tiger to be one that he
had, not long before, brought to England,
and which had been his especial care.</p>

<p>It now was Jack’s turn to be delighted,
as it appears the tiger was, in thus recognizing
his old friend; and, after making
repeated applications to be permitted to
enter the den, for the purpose, he said, of
“shaking a fist” with the beautiful animal,
he was suffered to do so. The iron
door was opened, and in jumped Jack, to
the delight of himself and his striped
friend, and the astonishment of the lookers-on.
The affection of the animal was
now shown by caressing and licking the
pleased sailor, whom he seemed to <a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>welcome
with the heartiest satisfaction; and
when the honest tar left the den, the anguish
of the poor animal seemed almost
insupportable.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Miss Pappoo.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">H<span class="sc">ere</span> she is&mdash;&#8203;Miss Pappoo&mdash;&#8203;all the
way from New Guinea&mdash;&#8203;a specimen
of humanity which shows the lovely,
fascinating, bewitching effect of an
exuberant quantity of hair. It is all
her own, too! not purchased at Gilbert’s,
nor forced by beef marrow, antique oil,
bear’s grease, or Macassar ointment!
No; it is pure, genuine nature.</p>

<p>It may be that there are some persons
who cannot appreciate the loveliness of
Miss Pappoo’s locks; but every day, we
see in our streets, certain young and
middle-aged men, who strike us as kindred
spirits. They possess long, tangled
locks, and an immense quantity of
beard, covering each side of the face, the
throat, and the chin. Sometimes it is
permitted also to cover the upper lip.
This bushy beard gives to a man the
somewhat simpering aspect of an old
goat; but still, it would seem that many
of our beaux are delighted at making
such a figure. Their great desire seems
to be to run to hair.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked that in general
these excessively whiskered gentry have
low crowns, and of course a small quantity
of brains, and probably the little they
have is of rather an inferior quality.
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="pageno">145</span>
Still, they seem satisfied, nay, delighted&mdash;&#8203;conceited
even&mdash;&#8203;if they can make up
this deficiency with an enormous quantity
of bristles growing out of their
chins.</p>

<p>To all such persons, we present Miss
Pappoo, not doubting that there will be a
sympathy&mdash;&#8203;a fellow-feeling between her
and them. They truly can appreciate a
character so eminently distinguished for
hair. She is a native of the great island
of Papua, or New Guinea, lying in the
Pacific Ocean, near New Holland. She
is dressed in the highest fashion of her
country, and doubtless would pass for a
belle of the first order there.</p>

<p>Now, if any of our whiskered countrymen,
impelled by a fellow-feeling for
Miss Pappoo, are desirous of a nearer
acquaintance, we will do what we can
to bring about an introduction between
them and the fair Papuan. Let the letters
of all applicants be written upon pink
paper, perfumed with the otto of roses,
marked on the outside with Cupid’s bow,
and contain a specimen of the applicant’s
whiskers.</p>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">W<span class="sc">e</span> must not be too much captivated
with the deeds of those called
<em>great</em>. It often happens that their
victories and triumphs over others
are obtained by unfair means; their successes
are frequently purchased by meanness
and treachery; and thus it is that,
if we could see the truth even beneath
their rays of glory, we should sometimes
be taught to despise, rather than applaud
their actions. The fable that follows
may throw some light upon this subject.</p>

<p class="center smaller">THE GOLDEN SHIELD.</p>

<p>There was once a famous knight, who
went forth in search of adventures.
Now, he was a great coward and knave,
but he got himself a shield of burnished
gold, and so brilliant was it, that every
eye was dazzled which looked upon it.
When he met another knight, instead
of giving him fair and honorable fight,
he used to ride near him, and then slyly
and unawares, would stab him with a
dirk. His enemy would fall murdered
to the ground, but the people, being dazzled
by the glittering armor, would cry
out, “Victory and honor to the knight of
the golden shield!”</p>

<p class="center ls">VANITY.</p>

<p>This folly or vice usually belongs to
the weak and the idle&mdash;&#8203;those who do
little good to others, and are mostly occupied
in thinking of themselves. Vanity
is generally large and strong in proportion
to the littleness of the individual
who exercises it: one who is its victim,
is incapable of judging of things rightly;
even in the presence of what is great
and sublime, he is blind to everything

<h3 class="h3head">Pictures of Various Nations.</h3>

<p class="center ls">CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">I &thinsp;<span class="sc">could</span> tell you a great deal more
about the Indians, especially of the
Cherokees, Creeks, Chickasaws, and
other tribes, which have been removed
by the government of the United
States to a fine country northwest of
Louisiana, where they have schools and
churches, and cultivate their lands, and
live much like white people. But I am
afraid I am making too long a story. I
shall, therefore, tell you something of
certain queer tribes that seem to be a
mixture of the American Indian and Esquimaux,
and then proceed to other countries.</p>

<p class="center ls">NOOTKA SOUND.</p>

<p>Let us cross to the western side of the
continent of America. Here, far to the
northwest, we find Nootka Sound, which
is a bay in the Pacific Ocean, discovered
by captain Cook, in 1778. Around this
bay live a set of people, who in some
respects differ from the North American
Indians, though they have many traits in
common with them.</p>

<p>On board one of the vessels which
first entered Nootka Sound, in 1778, was
John Ledyard, one of our own countrymen.
He resided in Hartford some time
after his return, where he wrote an account
of his voyage. That account I
have seen, and in it he speaks of the inhabitants
who live round the Sound.</p>

<p>He says that the people there resemble
the Indians on this side of the Rocky
Mountains. They are tall, robust, and
well made; but in this last respect, they
do not equal the Indians farther east.
Some of the women, however, appeared
quite handsome.</p>

<p>They have large and full faces, high
and prominent cheek bones, small and
black eyes, broad and flat noses, thick
lips, and teeth of the most brilliant whiteness.
They fill their hair with oil, paint,
and the down of birds. They also paint
their faces with red, blue, and white colors.
They look odd enough.</p>

<p>Some accounts represent them to be a
<span class="pageno">147</span>
quiet, peaceable people; but others say
that they are bold and ferocious. They
give some evidence of being rather a
wise people,&mdash;&#8203;they do not talk much;
but, perhaps, it is because they have not
many ideas. This last, I think, is true,
for they have no books, and no means of
knowing much.</p>

<p>I am sorry to add, that they are said
to be cannibals; that is, they eat human
flesh. Ledyard saw, when he was there,
not only human skulls and bones for
sale; but, also, human flesh ready cooked.
This made the sailors shudder, and well
it might.</p>

<p>The only inhabited parts of the Sound
are two villages, containing about two
thousand people. Their houses are
made of very long and broad plank,
resting upon the edges of each other,
fastened together by means of withes,
and supported by posts.</p>

<p>As you enter one of their houses,
you find benches raised on the sides of
the room. These are covered with mats,
upon which the family sit and sleep.
The fireplace is in the middle of the
floor, but they have neither hearth nor
chimney.</p>

<p>They have very fine furs; and when
Captain Cook was there, he purchased
some, not thinking they were very valuable,
but when he arrived in China,
he sold skins, which cost but sixpence,
for a hundred dollars. Since Captain
Cook’s time, many vessels have been to
Nootka Sound after furs, and made their
voyages very profitable.</p>

<p>I will only add, that Nootka Sound
lies west of Boston, about three thousand
miles. But should any of my readers
over go thither, they will probably go by
water. In this case, if they sail from
New York, they will proceed south
along the American coast, round Cape
Horn, and then north to the Sound.
The voyage will take them about five
months, and they will sail not less than
fifteen thousand miles.</p>

<p class="center ls">ONALASKA.</p>

<p>Before we return to the eastern side
of the continent, we must notice the people
who inhabit the Fox Islands, the
largest of which is called Onalaska.
This island lies in the Pacific Ocean, at
some distance from the peninsula of
Alaska, as you may perceive by looking
on a map.</p>

<p>This island, also, was first discovered
by Captain Cook, in 1778. The inhabitants
here are described as being in
stature about middle size, with full
round faces, flat noses, black eyes and
hair, but no beard; for this they pluck
out by the roots as soon as it begins to
grow. Their skin is quite dark, but is
rendered still more so by the manner in
which they live.</p>

<p>The inhabitants appear to be good-natured
and benevolent; but if their anger
is once roused, it is not easily allayed.
Their common dress, in rainy weather,
is a garment, made of the entrails of the
sea-dog. This secures them against the
rain. In dry and cold weather, they
wear a garment made of feathers, curiously
sewed together, and which costs a
person sometimes a whole year’s labor.
Their hats are made of wood, and very
much resemble an umbrella.</p>

<p>They are quite fond of ornaments,
particularly beads, and small ivory figures
cut from the teeth of the sea-cow,
<span class="pageno">148</span>
and with the bristles of the sea-lion’s
beard&mdash;&#8203;all of which they put upon their
hats. The women ornament themselves
with rings upon their fingers, and with
belts of glass beads upon their wrists and
ankles.</p>

<p>The houses in which they dwell are
large holes, dug in the ground, and covered
with a roof, over which earth is
thrown, and grass grows upon it. In
the centre of the roof a hole is cut.
This is all the door, window, and chimney
which they have. They enter the
house, and go out of it, by means of an
upright post, with pins in it. Their
habitations are generally filthy places.
They are filled with the smoke of burnt
oil, which they use for light and cooking.
They live principally upon fish
and sea-dogs.</p>

<p>The canoes of these people are very
ingenious. They build a wooden frame,
which they cover with sea-dogs’ skins.
They are light, and are pushed forward
in the water with amazing rapidity.</p>

<p class="center ls">CANADA.</p>

<p>It is a long distance from the island
of Onalaska to Canada; but as <em>we</em> travel,
we are soon there. Canada now belongs
to Great Britain, and there are many
English, Scotch and Irish people resident
there; but it was first settled by the
French, and there are more French than
there are English. Some Americans,
also, have settled there, for the purpose
of trade.</p>

<p>The English and American inhabitants
of Canada are intelligent and polished
people, resembling the higher classes
in England and America. These live
principally in the large towns and cities.</p>

<p>The common people, or true Canadians,
are French. They speak the
French language; but it has lost much
of its purity. Few among them know
how either to read or write. They are,
however, quite an honest, hospitable, and
inoffensive people. They are very poor;
and no wonder they are so, for they are
a very lazy people. They seem to have
few wants, and to be quite happy, and
contented with their condition. Within
a few years they have improved somewhat;
but it will be a long time before
they make much advance.</p>

<p>At an early period of life, the Canadian
is healthy and robust; but he soon
looks old and sallow, owing to his exposure
to the weather, and the toils of
the field. This is also true of the women,
many of whom are quite handsome
when young; but they soon fade.
Both men and women frequently live,
however, to advanced age.</p>

<p>Canada is a cold country. The winters
are long and severe. The inhabitants
protect themselves when they go
abroad, by means of furs, in which they
envelop themselves. They travel, during
the cold season, in a kind of sledge,
or open carriage, called a cariole. In
these, they glide over deep snows and
frozen rivers, with surprising celerity.</p>

<p>At the beginning of winter, the farmers,
who are called <em>habitants</em>, kill hogs,
cattle, and poultry, sufficient to serve
them till spring, as well as to supply the
markets. The carcasses they store in
their garrets, where they soon become
frozen, and keep without injury; or they
bury them, and dig them out as wanted.
Vegetables are preserved in a similar
manner. The French Canadians are
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pageno">149</span>
chiefly Roman Catholics; the other inhabitants
are of various sects.</p>

<p><span class="sc">I don’t want to go!</span>&mdash;A curious incident
occurred near Paris, not long since,
in consequence of a balloon starting on
its own hook, without the consent of the
proprietor. A large concourse of people
had assembled to see an æronaut
take flight for the regions of upper air,
but, unfortunately, before he took his
seat in the car, the ærostat got loose, and
the grappling-hook, which was dangling

<p>The women screamed and fainted, but
the lad, who seemed to have been a hero
in his way, clasped the rope tightly with
his hands and his feet, and, with an awful
rent in his aforesaids, was introduced
by his inflated companion into the <em>upper

descended, and deposited the little

<h3 class="h3head">A Chinese Dandy.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">he</span> following description of a Chinese
exquisite, is from a new work on
China, by P. Dobel, formerly Russian
Consul to China, and a resident
in that country for seven <span class="lock">years:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“His dress is composed of crapes and
silks of great price, his feet are covered
with high-heeled boots of the most beautiful
Nankin satin, and his legs are encased
in gaiters, richly embroidered, and
reaching to the knee. Add to this an
acorn-shaped cap of the latest taste, an
elegant pipe, richly ornamented, in which
burns the purest tobacco of the Fokien,
an English watch, a toothpick suspended
to a button by a string of pearls, a Nankin
<span class="pageno">150</span>

tcholane, (a Chinese flower,) and you
will have an exact idea of a fashionable
Chinese.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The Chinese dandy, like dandies of
all times and all countries, is seriously
occupied with trifles. He belongs either
to the Quail Club or the Cricket Club.
Like the ancient Romans, the Chinese
train quails, quarrelsome birds, intrepid
duellists, whose combats form the subject
of senseless wagers. In imitation
of the rich, the poorer Chinese place at
the bottom of an earthen basin, two field
crickets. These insects they excite and
provoke, until they grow angry, attack
each other, and the narrow field of battle
is soon strewed with their claws, antennæ
and corselets.</p>

there is between the combats of the

<h3 class="h3head">A Thrilling Narrative.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">he</span> town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Etienne, in the department
of the Loire, has acquired, by
its manufactures of iron and silk, the
appellation of the Birmingham and
Coventry of France. Though very far
from contemptible, it is however, at most,
only a miniature likeness of the two celebrated
towns to which it is compared.
For its prosperity, it is indebted to the
circumstance of iron oar and coal being
abundant in its vicinity. Among the coal
mines in its immediate neighborhood, is
that of Bois Monzil, the scene of the
event which is now to be described.</p>

<p>On the 2d of February, 1831, about
eight in the morning, when there were
twenty-six men at work, a sudden detonation
was heard, instantly followed by
the roar of water, rushing from the adjoining
pit. The cry of alarm was
quickly spread through the mine, but
only ten of the laborers were able to
reach the entrance. One of them was
driven forward with such violence, by
the condensed air and the torrent, that
his escape was miraculous; another was
so terrified, that he hurried forward,
without thinking to disencumber himself
of a sack of coals which he had upon
his shoulders; a third, who possessed
both presence of mind and humanity,
snatched up a boy of eleven years old
and bore him away in his arms.</p>

<p>Eight individuals perished. Some of
them were swept away by the deluge&mdash;&#8203;but
at least one of them had to endure a
lingering death. He was heard for some
hours knocking against the sides of his
prison; at the end of that time the
knocking ceased&mdash;&#8203;the flood had overwhelmed
him. The remaining eight
workmen were fortunate enough to
reach a gallery on a higher level; but,
as it had no other outlet than that by
which they entered, their fate was certain,
unless the water should recede, or
their friends could open a passage
through the rock beneath them.</p>

<p>On hearing of the accident, the engineers
of the mine hastened with their
assistants to the spot. Thirty hours
elapsed before the miners could penetrate
into some of the lower galleries
from which the water had retired. They
repeatedly called aloud to their lost companions,
but no voice was heard in reply.
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pageno">151</span>
They then struck with their pickaxes
upon the roof, and after several fruitless
trials, they were rejoiced to hear an
equal number of answering knocks.</p>

<p>Measures were immediately adopted
for opening a communication with the
imprisoned men; the principal of them
were the boring a hole through the rock,
in the supposed direction whence the
sound came, and the forming of an inclined
tunnel. But there was much difficulty
in ascertaining the point to which
they ought to direct their efforts; for the
sound of their blows on the roof, far from
offering a certain criterion, or at least a
probable one, seemed each time to excite
fresh doubts. The rock, too, was so hard
and thick, that the gunpowder employed
in blasting it produced but a trifling effect;
nor could the pumps be got to work,
and they were therefore obliged to resort
to the slow and incompetent method of
forming a line of men from the gallery
to the mouth of the mine, and passing
the buckets from hand to hand.</p>

<p>The persons who were thus employed,
had to work upon a rapid slope, in a
crouching posture, with the water dropping
all round them, and generally rising
up to the middle of their bodies.
They had to endure that which was still
worse to men not devoid of humanity.
The wives of the hapless miners had
heard that all hope was not extinct, and
they hastened to the spot. With heart-rending
cries, and shedding tears alternately
of despair and hope, they exclaimed,
“Are they <em>all</em> there? Where
is the father of my children? Is <em>he</em>
amongst them, or has he been swallowed
up by the waters?”</p>

<p>When it became known at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Etienne
and its vicinity, that there was a prospect
of saving a part of the victims, the
whole of the National Guards, and several
hundreds of miners and other persons,
thronged to lend their assistance.
The pumps were now got to work, and
the line of men with buckets was consequently
discontinued. Yet, notwithstanding
the number of additional hands, the
work proceeded but slowly. Such was
the flinty hardness of the rock, that frequently
the tools either broke, or remained
immovably fixed in the stone.
The water also filtered in rapidly through
the perforation which they were making,
and seemed to threaten another irruption.</p>

<p>It was now Sunday, and the spirits of
the workmen began to flag. On the
following day an alarming incident occurred
which spread a general panic.
A terrific noise was heard, which was
prolonged in echoes throughout the mine.
When their terror had sufficiently subsided
to allow of their investigating its
cause, they found that an enormous mass
of rock had fallen into one of the draining
wells. Though this fall was attended
by no bad consequences, the workmen
were so much disheartened by it,
that it required much management to
bring them back to their labors, and revive
their courage and perseverance.</p>

<p>By dint of persuasion and argument,
the superintendents at length prevailed
on the men to make a vigorous effort.
In a very short time, that effort was
crowned with success. The instrument
of one of the miners penetrated into the
shut-up gallery, and was drawn from his
hands by the poor imprisoned miners.
But the man who had thus been the first
to open a way into their dungeon, was
<span class="pageno">152</span>
still more unfortunate than they were.
At the moment when hope dawned to
them, it set forever to him. He was the
father of one of the men who had disappeared
in the mine. His paternal feelings
seemed to have endowed him with
superhuman strength. Night and day he
quitted his work only for a few minutes
to return to it with redoubled vigor.</p>

<p>One absorbing thought occupied his
whole soul; the idea that his son, his
<em>only</em> son, was with those who were heard
from within. In vain he was solicited
to retire; in vain they strove to force
him from labors too fatiguing for his
age. “My son is among them,” said
he; “I hear him; nothing shall prevent
me from hastening his release;” and
from time to time he called on his son,
in accents that tore the hearts of the bystanders.
His first question, on the instrument
being drawn from his hand,
was, “My child!” His Antoine was
no more; he had been drowned.</p>

<p>For four days, medical men had been
present in the mine, to be ready to give
their aid, as soon as a passage should be
opened. They now directed soup to be
introduced through a tube, and air to be
forced into the gallery by means of bellows.
Food was, however, by no means
the most urgent want of the captives;
light was what they first and most pressingly
requested. A tinder-box was conveyed
to them, but the vitiated air of their
dungeon rendered it of no use. At first,
they seemed to be strengthened by the
soup, of which they had made their oldest
and weakest companions the earliest
partakers; but afterwards it had a contrary
effect. They therefore for the
present rejected the nourishment which
was occasionally supplied, and expressed
but one wish, which was that their
friends would make haste. Yet one at
least there was, who had not lost all his
gaiety. This was a man, named Fereol.
When he was asked what day he
thought it was, be replied, “Sunday;”
and upon being told it was Monday, he
rejoined, “Ah, I ought to have known
that&mdash;&#8203;for yesterday we indulged ourselves
by tippling freely&mdash;&#8203;of water.”</p>

<p>But though some of them retained
their cheerfulness, the strength of all was
rapidly failing. Their utterance grew
gradually more faint; and about six in
the evening, the last words that could be
distinguished were, “Brothers, make
haste.” By ten in the evening, they
had broken through sixteen feet of solid
rock, and liberated the captives. Looking
more like spectres than human beings,
the miners, one by one, slowly
traversed the gallery, and emerged into
open air, which they had so recently
almost despaired of ever breathing again.
From the mouth of the mine to the temporary
residence allotted them, the whole
way was illuminated. The engineers,
the pupils, and the workmen, with the
National Guard under arms, were drawn
up in two lines to form a passage; and
thus, in the midst of a religious silence,
did these poor fellows traverse an attentive
and sympathizing crowd, who, as
they passed along, inclined their heads,
as a sort of respect and honor to their
sufferings.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="sc">Generosity</span> is a pleasant, agreeable,

<h3 class="h3head">Demosthenes.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">his</span> greatest of the Grecian orators
was born about 385 or 384 years
before Christ, when Athens had
reached the zenith of her literary,
and had passed that of her political
glory. Juvenal has represented him
slightingly as the son of a blacksmith,
the fact being that the elder Demosthenes
was engaged in various branches of
trade, and among others was owner of
a sword manufactory. His maternal
grandmother was a Thracian woman,
a circumstance noticeable because it
enabled his enemies, in the spirit of exaggeration
and ill-will, to taunt him as
a barbarian and hereditary enemy of
his country&mdash;&#8203;for the Greeks in general
regarded the admixture of barbarian,
<span class="pageno">154</span>
that is, other than Greek blood, with the
same sort of contempt and dislike as do
the whites of America the taint of African
descent.</p>

<p>Being left an orphan when seven
years old, Demosthenes fell into the
hands of dishonest guardians, who embezzled
a large portion of the property
which his father had bequeathed to him.
His constitution appears to have been
delicate, and it may have been on this
account, that he did not attend the gymnastic
exercises, which formed a large
portion of the education of the youths in
Greece; exercises really important where
neither birth nor wealth set aside the
obligation to military service common to
all citizens; and where, therefore, skill
in the use of arms, strength, and the
power to endure fatigue and hardship,
were essential to the rich as well as to
the poor. It may have been on this
account that a nickname expressive of
effeminacy was bestowed on him, which
was afterwards interpreted into a proof
of unmanly luxury and vicious habits;
indeed, the reproach of wanting physical
strength stuck by him through
life, and apparently not undeservedly.
Another nickname that he obtained was
that of “Viper.” In short, the extant
anecdotes tend pretty uniformly to show
that his private character was harsh and
unamiable.</p>

<p>His ambition to excel as an orator is
said to have been kindled by hearing a
masterly and much admired speech of
Callistratus. For instruction, he resorted
to Isæus, and, as some say, to Isocrates,
both eminent teachers of the art of rhetoric.
He had a stimulus to exertion in
the resolution to prosecute his guardians
for the abuse of their trust; and having
gained the cause, B. C. 364, in the conduct
of which he himself took an active
part, recovered, it would seem, a large
part of his property. The orations
against Aphobus and Onetor profess to
have been delivered in the course of the
suit; but it has been doubted, on internal
evidence, whether they were really composed
by him so early in life.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, his success emboldened
him to come forward as a speaker
in the assemblies of the people: on what
occasion, and at what time, does not appear.
His reception was discouraging.
He probably had underrated, till taught
by experience, the degree of training and
mechanical preparation requisite at all
times to excellence, and most essential in
addressing an audience so alive to the
ridiculous and so fastidious as the Athenians.
He labored also under physical
defects, which almost amounted to disqualifications.
His voice was weak, his
breath short, his articulation defective;
in addition to all this, his style was
thought strained, harsh, and involved.</p>

<p>Though disheartened by his ill success,
he felt, as Sheridan is reported to have
expressed himself on a similar occasion,
that it was in him, and it should come
out; beside, he was encouraged by a few
discerning spirits. One aged man, who
had heard Pericles, cheered him with
the assurance that he reminded him of
that unequalled orator; and the actor
Satyrus pointed out the faults of his
delivery, and instructed him to amend
them. He now set himself in earnest to
realize his notions of excellence; and the
singular and irksome method which he
adopted, denoting certainly no common
<span class="pageno">155</span>
energy and strength of will, are too celebrated
and too remarkable to be omitted,
though the authority on which they rest
is not free from doubt. He built a room
under ground, where he might practise
gesture and delivery without molestation,
and there he spent two or three
months together, shaving his head that
the oddity of his appearance might render
it impossible for him to go abroad,
even if his resolution should fail. The
defect in his articulation he cured by
reciting with small pebbles in his mouth.
His lungs he strengthened by practising
running up hill, while reciting verses.
Nor was he less diligent in cultivating
mental, than bodily requisites, applying
himself earnestly to study the theory of
the art, as explained in books, and the
examples of the greatest masters of eloquence.
Thucydides is said to have
been his favorite model, insomuch that
he copied out his history eight times,
and had it almost by heart.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his pen was continually
employed in rhetorical exercises; every
question suggested to him by passing
events served him for a topic of discussion,
which called forth the application
of his attainments to the real business of
life. It was perhaps as much for the
sake of such practice, as with a view to
reputation, or the increase of his fortune,
that he accepted employment as an advocate,
which, until he began to take an
active part in public affairs, was offered
to him in abundance.</p>

<p>Such was the process by which he
became confessedly the greatest orator
among the people by whom eloquence
was cultivated, as it has never been since
by any nation upon earth. He brought
it to its highest state of perfection, as did
Sophocles the tragic drama, by the harmonious
union of excellences which had
before only existed apart. The quality
in his writings which excited the highest
admiration of the most intelligent critics
among his countrymen, in the later critical
age, was the Protean versatility with
which he adapted his style to every
theme, so as to furnish the most perfect
examples of every order and kind of
eloquence.</p>

<p><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Demosthenes, like Pericles, never willingly
appeared before his audience with
any but the ripest fruits of his private
studies, though he was quite capable of
speaking on the impulse of the moment
in a manner worthy of his reputation.
He continued to the end of his career
to cultivate the art with unabated diligence,
and even in the midst of public
business, his habits were known to
be those of a severe student.</p>

<p>The first manifestation of that just
jealousy of Philip, the ambitious king
of Macedon, which became the leading
principle of his life, was made B. C. 352,
when the orator delivered the first of
those celebrated speeches called Philippics.
The word has been naturalized
in Latin and most European languages,
as a concise term to signify indignant
invective.</p>

<p>From this time forward, it was the
main object of Demosthenes to inspire
and keep alive in the minds of the
Athenians a constant jealousy of Philip’s
power and intentions, and to unite
the other states of Greece in confederacy
against him. The policy and the disinterestedness
of his conduct have both
been questioned; the former, by those
<span class="pageno">156</span>
who have judged, from the event, that
resistance to the power of Macedonia
was rashly to accelerate a certain and
inevitable evil; the latter, by those, both
of his contemporaries and among posterity,
who believe that he received
bribes from Persia, as the price of
finding employment in Greece for an
enemy, whose ambition threatened the
monarch of the East. With respect to
the former, however, it was at least the
most generous policy, and that of the
elder Athenians in their most illustrious
days, not to await the ruin of their independence
submissively, until every
means had been tried for averting it;
for the latter, such charges are hard
either to be proved or refuted. The
character of Demosthenes certainly does
not stand above the suspicion of pecuniary
corruption, but it has not been
shown, nor is it necessary or probable to
suppose, that his jealousy of Philip of
Macedon was not in the first instance
far-sighted and patriotic. During fourteen
years, from 352 to 338, he exhausted
every resource of eloquence and
diplomatic skill to check the progress of
that aspiring monarch; and whatever
may be thought of his moral worth, none
can undervalue the genius and energy,
which have made his name illustrious,
and raised a memorial of him far more
enduring than sepulchral brass.</p>

<p>In 339, B. C., Philip’s appointment to
be general of the Amphyctionic League
gave him a more direct influence than
he had yet possessed; and in the same
year, the decisive victory of Cheronea,
won over the combined forces of Thebes,
Athens, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, made him master of Greece.
Demosthenes served in this engagement,
but joined early in the flight, with circumstances,
according to report, of
marked cowardice and disgrace. He
retired for a time from Athens, but the
cloud upon his character was but transient;
for shortly after he was entrusted
with the charge of putting the city in a
state of defence, and was appointed to
pronounce the funeral oration over those
who had been slain. After the battle of
Cheronea, Philip, contrary to expectation,
did not prosecute hostilities against
Athens; on the contrary, he used his
best endeavors to conciliate the affections
of the people, but without success;
the party hostile to Macedon soon regained
the superiority, and Demosthenes
was proceeding with his usual
vigor in the prosecution of his political
schemes, when news arrived of the murder
of Philip, in July, 336.</p>

<p>The daughter of Demosthenes had then
lately died; nevertheless, in violation of
national usage, he put off his mourning,
and appeared in public crowned with
flowers, and with other tokens of festive
rejoicing. This act, a strong expression
of triumph over the fall of a most
dangerous enemy, has been censured
with needless asperity; the accusation
of having been privy to the plot for Philip’s
murder beforehand, founded on his
own declaration of the event some time
before intelligence of it came from any
other quarter, and the manifest falsehood
as to the source of the information,
which he professed to derive from a
divine revelation, involves, if it be judged
to be well founded, a far blacker imputation.</p>

<p>Whether or not it were of his own
procuring, the death of Philip was hailed
<span class="pageno">157</span>
by Demosthenes as an event most fortunate
for Athens, and favorable to the
liberty of Greece. Thinking lightly of
the young successor to the Macedonian
crown, he busied himself the more in
stirring up opposition to Alexander, and
succeeded in urging Thebes into that
revolt, which ended in the entire destruction
of the city, B. C. 335. This example,
as it well might, struck terror into
Athens. Alexander demanded that Demosthenes,
with nine others, should be
given up into his hands, as the authors
of the battle of Cheronea, and of the succeeding
troubles of Greece; but finally
contented himself with requiring the
banishment of Charidemus alone.</p>

<p>Opposition to Macedon was now effectually
put down, and until the death of
Alexander we hear little more of Demosthenes
as a public man. During this
period, however, one of the most memorable
incidents of his life occurred in
that contest of oratory with Æschines,
which has been more celebrated than
any strife of words since the world
began. The origin of it was as follows.
About the time of the battle of Cheronea,
one Ctesiphon brought before the people
a decree for presenting Demosthenes
with a crown for his distinguished services;
a complimentary motion, in its
nature and effects very much like a vote
of parliament declaratory of confidence
in the administration. Æschines, the
leading orator of the opposite party,
arraigned this motion, as being both
untrue in substance and irregular in
form; he indicted Ctesiphon on these
grounds, and laid the penalty at fifty
talents, equivalent to about $45,000.
Why the prosecution was no long delayed,
does not clearly appear; but it
was not brought to an issue until the
year 330, when Æschines pronounced
his great oration “against Ctesiphon.”
Demosthenes defended him in the still
more celebrated speech “on the crown.”
These, besides being the most admirable
specimens of rhetorical art, have the
additional value, that the rival orators,
being much more anxious to uphold the
merits of their own past policy and conduct,
than to convict or defend the nominal
object of prosecution, have gone
largely into matters of self-defence and
mutual recrimination, from which much
of our knowledge of this obscure portion
of history is derived. Æschines lost
the cause, and not having the votes of
so much as a fifth part of the judges,
became liable, according to the laws of
Athens, to fine and banishment. He
withdrew to Rhodes, where he established
a school of rhetoric.</p>

<p>Demosthenes roused the Athenians
against Antipater the successor of Alexander
in Greece, but when that general
triumphed, he fled to Calmesia, and took
refuge in a temple. He retired into the
inner part of the building, on pretence
of writing a letter, where he took poison
and speedily died.</p>

<p>Such was the life of Demosthenes, the
greatest orator Greece ever produced, and
one of the most famous that ever lived.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Walking on Stilts.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">I<span class="sc">n</span> some countries the inhabitants walk
on stilts from necessity. In England,
boys do so for fun; and it is astonishing
with what agility, after a very short
practice, they do so. Any boy may
make his own stilts; nothing is required
but a pair of poles, about six or seven
feet long, upon which some broad pieces
of leather or iron hoop are nailed for the
feet, so as to leave the top of the stilt
within a few inches of the arm-pit. The
boy may at first place his foot-holds very
low, till he can balance himself, and then
raise them every few days, till he obtains
a complete command over them. I have
known boys who had great command
over stilts, to wade through rivers three or
four feet deep; which would be of some
importance in certain situations, to which
all are subject, as by such aids small
rivers might at any time be crossed, and
life even saved in a case of necessity.</p>

<p>I once, however, knew a boy, who,
having attained this art in great perfection,
was not content with amusing himself
in a rational and innocent manner,
but set his wits to work to frighten two
of his playfellows, a little boy and girl,
who lived in the neighborhood. He had
often heard foolish people talk of ghosts,
and thought it would be good fun to
make one; so he got a large white tablecloth,
and having scraped out the inside
of a turnip, so as to leave nothing but
the rind, he cut two holes for eyes, made
an enormous mouth with gnashing teeth;
in this he put a lantern, and putting himself
on his stilts, which made him seven
feet high, and fastening the turnip lantern
to his hat, he sallied forth into a
by-lane, where he knew his play-fellows
were to pass.</p>

<p>After a while he heard their footsteps,
and then he made himself ready by pulling
his white garment about him, and
placing himself under the shade of an
old tree. Then he gave a loud, unearthly
groan, and with a slow and
measured step came forth. It was
nearly dark, and a little girl and boy
came gaily on, singing and dancing.
But the moment the little girl saw the
supposed spectre, she gave a thrilling
scream, and dropped senseless on the
ground. Her brother, poor fellow, who
at once saw the trick, ran towards the
spectre, and with a blow of a stick which
he held in his hand, felled him to the
ground. He then ran to his sister, but
she was insensible. After a while, assistance
came; but when they had taken
the little girl home, and put her to bed,
they found that her senses had fled forever.
The fright had turned her brain,
and she became an idiot, and did not
live many years.</p>

<p>Be careful then, my young friends,
never to play upon the fears or feelings
of your companions. It is not only very
wicked, but cruel in the extreme; and
as the consequences may be serious,
guard yourself against every temptation
of the kind. A sudden start at the word
“Boo,” has been known to produce
severe illness; and it is by no means
an uncommon thing to hear of persons
meeting with sudden death through
fright.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="sc">It</span> is pleasant to some persons to give;
but if one gives only to gratify himself, he
is merely selfish, and can claim no praise.</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE SOLDIER.</p>

<p class="center">(Concluded.)</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Mr. Merry</span>:</p>

<p>Your young readers will remember, I hope,
that they left our “little soldier” at the commencement
of his journey homewards. Weak
and faint from his long confinement in the hospital,
without money, and with the sad prospect
of two hundred miles on foot before him, it
seemed impossible to him that he could ever
accomplish the journey. But “home,” that
blessed word, at mention of which, “the <em>sailor</em>,
clinging to the dripping yard-arm,” feels a glow
of rapture, filled the heart of the <em>soldier</em> with
hope, and he proceeded on. Children of the
present day, cannot imagine the change which
has been made in the country since that period.
What was at that time a “wilderness,” has
now become a “fruitful field;” and where our
tired soldiers at the close of the day sheltered
themselves beneath some large tree, may now
be seen the splendid hotel, inviting the traveller
to comfort and rest. Then, too, at the nightfall,
where <em>our</em> two friends heard only the
mournful note of the “whip-poor-will,” may
now be heard the shrill whistle of the locomotive,
as it scuds over mountain and valley with
the speed of thought. I cannot take time to
give the details of adventures which cheered
and discouraged our friends from day to day.
They found great difficulty in supplying themselves
with food; and I think it was in some
lonely place, on this journey, that the sick soldier
was fortunate enough to catch a young
woodpecker, and he said nothing could be more
delicious than the little bird. He pulled out the
feathers, and ate it <em>just as it was</em>! He said it
was meat and drink too, for the blood was
warm! If I am not mistaken, it was three or
four weeks after they left New York, that the
two friends reached a village, called Farmington,
in the State of Connecticut. They had
been a long time coming a short distance, as
the strength of the little soldier had been gradually
failing during the journey thus far. Just
at dark, after a day of great suffering from exhaustion
and fatigue, they came to a house
which stood on an eminence rather difficult of
ascent. Here, the poor fellow’s courage failed,
and he said to his companion, “Let me stop at
the foot of this hill and <em>die</em>. I can never reach
the house,”&mdash;and he sank upon the ground, entirely
overcome. His companion, however, had
strong confidence that if he could have food and
rest, he would soon be restored. He accordingly
went to the door of the house, which was
opened by a very respectable middle-aged woman.
He proceeded to an inner room, where
an old man was sitting, reading the Bible. He
made as earnest an appeal as he could for the
friend he had left in the road; but the thought
of having such a burden upon them, (for they
were rather poor,) seemed more than they could
bear. Now, whether the old gentleman happened
to be reading in Matthew, the passage,
“Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least
of these, ye did it unto me,” I cannot say; but
he did not hesitate long. “Let him come in,”
said he; “we will do the best we can for him.”
Here, then, new courage came to him, and, with
the utmost exertion, he reached the door. The
<em>table</em> was spread for the evening meal; and such
a sight our “little soldier” had not seen since
he left his father’s house, where was “bread
enough and to spare.” He has been heard to
say often, that at no other period in his life,
was he ever so much overcome, as at the sight
of that table! He wept and sobbed like an infant.
The utmost caution was needed, or he
would no doubt have sacrificed his life in the
indulgence of his appetite. At this house he
remained several weeks,&mdash;&#8203;and I would to God
that this account might fall into the hands of
some of the descendants of that pious family.
The man was named Thomas Cowles. A maiden
daughter kept the house, and took care of
her father. They were unwearied in their attentions
to the invalid, and he began to recruit
at once. His companion came on to their
native place, and a brother of the sick soldier
immediately started on horseback for him, with
money to remunerate the family who had shown
him so much kindness. When the young soldier
came to take his leave, which he did with
many tears, the good people refused all compensation.
Now, I hope, Mr. Merry, some of
your young readers will know why this was.
Our “little soldier” loved and feared God.
They had taken “sweet counsel together,” and
felt that they had their reward. Many years
after these events occurred, and after the little
traveller had been in the service of his Divine
Master a long time, an opportunity was given
to send to this daughter, who had survived her
father several years. With deep emotion he
took from his library a handsome volume, and
presented it to Miss Cowles, with the simple quotation,
“I was a stranger, and ye took me in.”</p>

<p>Should any one of the name meet with this
account&mdash;&#8203;a branch of that family&mdash;“may the
Lord bless them seven fold,” for their father’s
sake.</p>

<span class="sc">une</span>, the first of the summer
months, presents us
with many interesting
things. The meadows are
now covered with flowers
in full bloom: the forests have put on
their beautiful garments of green: the
birds are busy in tending their young;
the mornings are ushered in with silvery
dews, and the evenings come like
a soft veil thrown over the cradle of
her children, by the gentle hand of nature,
to make their slumbers sweet and
secure.</p>

<p>The farmer is now busy in gathering
his crop of hay,&mdash;&#8203;though, as he swings
his scythe, he unhappily disturbs many a
pretty nest of the meadow lark, the sparrow,
and the boblink. How the latter
does sing “Get out o’ the way old Dan
Tucker,”&mdash;as the mowers intrude upon
his dominion! However, it is better
that Bob should be disturbed now and
then, than that the cattle should starve,
and every body go without milk and
meat.</p>

<p>But let us go to some field, where the
mower has not yet appeared. Let us
stop and listen to Bob&mdash;&#8203;with his white
nightcap on. What a set of names he
has got&mdash;&#8203;boblink&mdash;&#8203;bob o’ lincoln&mdash;&#8203;skunk
black bird&mdash;&#8203;and rice bird. He seems to
have as many names as those rascals
who are sent to the state’s prison, yet he
has no other quality in common with
pick-pockets and counterfeiters. He is
<span class="pageno">162</span>
no thief, for what he takes he takes in
open day; he is no pick-pocket, for while
the cat-bird filches cherries, strawberries,
raspberries, and grapes, Bob is content
with the waste seeds of the meadows.
He is no counterfeiter,&mdash;&#8203;no, he is a downright
fellow, and is never ashamed of his
name. Meet him where you will, he
springs into the air, and seems to give
you a challenge in the following <span class="lock">words&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Jem Richardson, Jem Richardson,&mdash;&#8203;get
away&mdash;&#8203;yet away: it’s very disagreeable
of you to trouble us: get away!
get away!”</p>

<p>Different people fancy the boblink to
say different things. A girl of sixteen
blushes at his open, impertinent calling
out the name of her lover, which she supposed
a secret to every one but herself;
the miser thinks his song like the jingling
of keys; a tory fancies that the
rogue calls him a whig; a whig, that he
reviles him as a tory; a boy going home
from school, imagines that he is mocking
him for spelling the word <em>jingo</em>, with
two gs&mdash;&#8203;and a town-meeting orator, regards
him as a lecturer upon that species
of eloquence which at town-meetings is
usually displayed&mdash;&#8203;a succession of nasal,
brassy sounds, with very little sense.</p>

<p>But let us leave boblink to pursue his
cheerful, happy life, and look at that bird
with long legs and a sly appearance,
stealing through the grass. He is a
meadow lark,&mdash;&#8203;and a magnificent bird,
streaked with gray and brown upon the
back, with a breast of bright yellow.
See! he is very timid, and has already
flown. Alas, his flesh is excellent, and
man has taught him that there is danger
in his near approach. Yet listen to his
clear, shrill note, as he flies in the air.
See! there he lights on the topmost
bough of yonder apple-tree. How plaintive,
yet how beautiful, his prolonged
note! He is not, however, so sweet a
singer as the lark of Europe.</p>

<p>Let us take a stroll in yonder thicket.
How still and secluded is this little dell.
Not a sound is to be heard. Hush! I
heard a rustle among the bushes! Oh,
it is a brown thrush; there he sits, trying
to hide himself behind the oak leaves.
He has a nest near, and being engaged
in important business, does not wish to
be disturbed. He will not speak to you
till evening. If you are then within a
quarter of a mile, you will hear his song.
It consists of imitations and variations
that might put Ole Bull to the blush.
Some passages are exquisitely beautiful,
and would excite the envy of that conceited
bird, the English talk so much
of,&mdash;&#8203;the nightingale,&mdash;&#8203;a bird, that is so
solicitous to be heard, that it will sing
only in the night, when all honest birds
are asleep.</p>

<p>We will say no more of this month,
after introducing to you the following
description of it, in the oldest English
lay extant:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">“Summer is yeomen in&mdash;</div>

<h3 class="h3head">Inquisitive Jack.</h3>

<p class="p2 center ls">CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="center"><cite>About Quadrupeds.</cite></p>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">I &thinsp;<span class="sc">must</span> tell you that by this time, Jack
had learned to read, and this was now
a source of great delight to him. It
often happened that he could not go
into the fields to study nature, because
the weather was stormy, or perhaps it
was winter, and the ground was covered
with snow. It is true that his aunt Piper
was generally ready to answer his
questions, and to give him information&mdash;&#8203;but
she could not attend to him always.
Beside, he found in books that there
were more exact and scientific accounts
of birds, beasts, fishes, insects and other
things which interested him, than even
aunt Betsey Piper could give.</p>

<p>Thus, Jack devoted a good deal of his
time to reading, though he did not lay
aside his habit of observing and investigating.
This habit is very important, and I
advise all my young friends to adopt, and
continue it, however much they may
read. Reading will indeed store the
mind, and make it full of knowledge;
but observation and investigation render
that knowledge clear, distinct, and useful.
So, I wish to have every body
follow Jack’s plan to read a great deal,
and also to investigate a great deal.
Thinking is to the mind what exercise
is to the body&mdash;&#8203;it makes it strong, cheerful,
and full of health. Thus my plan
is that reading books and reading nature
should go together. Now, I will tell
you how Inquisitive Jack managed this.</p>

<p><span class="pageno">164</span>
One day, he was going through a little
wood, where he saw a squirrel running
along upon the fence. It was of a reddish
color, and exceedingly nimble. It
seemed almost to fly along the rails of the
fence, and at last, it mounted upon a
tree. It then ran about upon the limbs, and
sprang to another tree. Then it dashed
from tree to tree almost like a bird, until
at last, it reached a large oak. It now
seemed to consider itself out of the
reach of harm, and accordingly, it began
to chatter in the most extraordinary
manner. There was something about it
that made Jack feel that the fellow was
making fun of him. He was annoyed
at this, and picking up a stone, he hurled
it at the offender with all his force.</p>

<p>The squirrel dodged the stone, ran up
the tree a little higher, and chattered
louder than ever. It seemed to say
something like this, “Oh Jack&mdash;&#8203;Jack&mdash;&#8203;you
are a very silly fellow&mdash;&#8203;get you gone
and leave the woods to me and my
companions!&mdash;&#8203;chickaree!&mdash;&#8203;chickaree!&mdash;&#8203;chickaree!”
While the squirrel was
saying this, he flourished his long red
tail, and seemed to be in a state of violent
agitation.</p>

<p>When Jack went home, he told his
aunt Piper about the squirrel, but she
did not know as much of squirrels, as of
bees, butterflies, and birds, and therefore
she could not wholly satisfy his curiosity.
He therefore consulted a book
of natural history, and there he found a
full account of the red squirrel, or chickaree.
He found it described just as he
had seen it, and furthermore he learned
that it was one of the most lively of the
whole squirrel family; that it lives upon
nuts, and is common in the forests of
New England and the Middle States&mdash;&#8203;that
it builds its nest in hollow trees,
and lays up a store of its favorite fruit
against the winter season.</p>

<p>Now you will be able to see the advantage
of combining observation with reading;&mdash;&#8203;Jack
had seen the squirrel, had noticed
its color, form, air, and manners. He
had therefore distinct, indelible impressions
respecting these things, and when
he began to read about this squirrel, it was
of something he had seen; something
of which he had a lively knowledge;
something associated in his mind with
his walk through the woods, and the
pleasure of a ramble. He read, therefore,
with a keen delight; he understood
what he read, he remembered it all, and
he was incited to go on and pursue the
subject, till at last he had read the story
of the whole squirrel family, red, black
and gray!</p>

<p>I tell you this just to give you a specimen
of Jack’s way of combining observation
with reading. I must now tell
you about another thing, which I have
alluded to before. It would seem that
ideas resemble boys; they don’t love to
be alone. One idea wants another; and
several ideas want a good many others.
You show a child a beautiful shell, it
gives him a new idea, and that immediately
suggests a desire of other ideas,
and he asks, “Who made the shell?”
“Where did the shell come from?”
“What is it made of,” <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>I have almost got through my story,
so do not be impatient if I tell you one
thing more, and that is how Jack used
to think about what he saw and read.
I shall give you an instance. One day,
he was strolling through the fields, at a
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="pageno">165</span>
distance from any house, when he saw
a large hawk pounce down upon a rabbit.
The talons of the bird pierced the very
heart of the little animal, and it was almost
instantly killed, and borne away by
the destroyer, struggling however in the
pangs of death. As it was carried over
his head, Jack noticed the four legs of
the rabbit, and he began to reflect upon
the fact that a hawk has two legs, and a
rabbit four. Having made this comparison,
he proceeded to make others; and
now it struck him, for the first time, that
the whole feathered race are two-legged
creatures, while rabbits, squirrels, cats,
dogs, pigs, foxes, lions, tigers, cows,
horses, and elephants are four-legged
creatures. As he was thus ruminating
upon this matter, he happened to take
up his book, and he there found that the
animal creation is divided into groups&mdash;&#8203;such
as orders and classes, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, according
to their formation.</p>

<p>He learned that four-legged animals,
called <dfn>quadrupeds</dfn>, form one great class;
that birds form another class; fishes another;
reptiles another; and insects still
another. And in pursuing this subject,
he found that each class was divided into
many families or kinds. Among the
quadrupeds, he found the family of cats,
including old puss in the corner, as well
as the lynx, cougar, leopard, tiger, and
lion. He learned that among the bears,
there are many kinds, and also among the
wolves and foxes, and all other races of
animals.</p>

<p>And now, a new source of interest
grew up in Jack’s mind. This <em>classifying</em>
of animals became intensely interesting.
He loved to compare one kind
with another; to note the resemblances
and differences; to observe the influence
of climate, and see how nature had diversified
her works, so as to adapt everything
to the purpose it was designed to
accomplish. Thus, at every step, his
knowledge increased, and became more
and more permanently fixed in his mind;
while the interest he took in study, was
enhanced even in a greater degree.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Sketches in Egypt.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">I<span class="sc">n</span> a former number of our Museum,
we have given some account of the
wonderful things, displaying the manners
and customs of the Egyptians,
and setting forth many points of history,
which have been discovered among the
ruins of their ancient cities and temples.
We now give a few passages, showing
some of the manners and customs of the
present inhabitants of Egypt.</p>

<p class="center sc lowercase">IRRIGATION.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of Egypt, even
in the Delta, there are numerous canals
to preserve the water after the overflow;
and from these the country is supplied
with moisture. The lands in Upper
Egypt&mdash;&#8203;to aid the process of artificial
irrigation&mdash;&#8203;are dug into small squares,
connected by gutters or furrows; and
the water, being raised from the stream
either with a machine or by manual labor,

flows from one square into another. This
operation forms the most laborious part

where the Persian water-wheel is not in
use.</p>

<p>Immediately after the water has run
off, sowing commences, the seed only
<span class="pageno">166</span>
requiring to be strewed over the land,
when it sinks into the soft earth by its
own weight, or is trodden down by the
cattle driven over it; a process generally
performed in November. The harvest
commences in April, when the corn is
cut with a sickle, close to the ear, and
the straw is appropriated for fodder, or
converted into fuel. The ears, having
been carried from the field in baskets,
are laid upon the ground. A sort of
sledge drawn by oxen is then driven
over it, which answers the end of thrashing,
separating the corn from the ears.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>
It is next stored, and the husbandman
having none of the labors of ploughing,
furrowing, or manuring his land&mdash;&#8203;those
duties being superseded by the
bounteous Nile&mdash;&#8203;he is at leisure till the
next overflow.</p>

<p class="center sc lowercase">MARRIAGE.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i059.jpg"
 width="60%"
 alt="Marriage procession"

 <p class="center caption">Marriage procession.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>A day or two before the wedding, the
bride elect goes in procession to the public
bath, which is often hired exclusively
<span class="pageno">167</span>
for her and her friends. A canopy of silk
is borne over her by four men, preceded
by musicians, and sometimes by persons
who perform some feat of strength
or a mock fight with swords; the female
relations of the maiden are also of the
party; and when in the bath, the company
is amused by <em>almehs</em> and other
musicians.</p>

<p>On returning from the bath the bride
takes a large lump of henna, and going
round to her guests solicits a contribution
of money, when each person generally
sticks a small piece of gold into the
henna, which on being relieved of the
coins, is afterwards applied to her hands
and feet. The evening of this ceremony
is called “The night of the henna.”</p>

<p>The next day, the bride proceeds to
the house of her future lord in the same
order as when she goes to the bath; and
on arriving at the harem all her friends
leave her, except her mother or other near
relation, the bridegroom remaining below
with his friends. Sometimes he
goes to a mosque, and on his return, after
seeing the company supplied with
pipes and sherbet, is for the first time introduced
to his wife; and having been
left alone with her he presents her
money, which is called “the price of
uncovering the face.” This is an awkward
moment for the bride, whose form
and features do not always bear out the
praises that the match-maker has previously
bestowed on them by way of
description; and lovers have been known
to betray disappointment at this delicate
juncture. On removing the covering it
is however proper for him to say, “In
the name of God, the compassionate,
the merciful, blessed be this night!” the
lady must answer “God bless thee!”
Several women are stationed outside the
door, who, at a signal from the bridegroom,
set up cries of joy&mdash;&#8203;which are
responded to by others below and in the
neighborhood&mdash;&#8203;to signify that he acknowledges
his bride, and that she equals
his expectations: these ceremonies over,
the man rejoins his male friends, with
whom he spends an hour or two in sociality,
and then returns to his wife.</p>

<p class="center sc lowercase">MOSQUES.</p>

<p>The houses of worship in Cairo are
magnificent and spacious. The principal
mosque, called the church of Lazarus,
is situated in the middle of the city.
Van Egmont says that between five and
six thousand persons receive their subsistence
from it, and that two thousand
lie in it every night. Formerly the interior
was as a sealed book to all who
did not follow the faith of the prophet;
for, if any stranger happened to enter it,
he was instantly imprisoned, and his only
chance of escape from death was to turn
Mohammedan.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

 <p class="center caption">Great Mosque of Sultan Hassan, Grand Cairo.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The minarets, or high towers of the
mosques, are surrounded, at a great
elevation, with projecting galleries, in
which stand the public criers, who announce
the stated times of prayer prescribed
by the Mohammedan law. Upwards
of eight hundred voices may be
heard at once from these lofty stations,
from which, also, prayers are on extraordinary
occasions, offered up.</p>

<p class="center sc lowercase">BURIALS.</p>

<p>The Egyptians seldom keep a corpse
in their houses on the night succeeding
death; and never bury their dead after
sunset. Rose-water, camphor, and other
perfumes, are sprinkled over the deceased,
<span class="pageno">168</span>
his nostrils and ears are stuffed
with cotton, the ankles bound, and the
hands placed over his breast. If he have
been a man of wealth, he is wrapped
successively in layers of muslin, cotton
cloth, and cloth of cotton and silk, and
lastly, a Cashmere shawl. He is then
placed on a bier, and a procession is
formed of chanters, with the relations
and domestics of the deceased; and
passages from the Koran, with a dirge,
are recited during the way. The bier is
first carried into a mosque, when the imán
and his assistant repeat certain prayers
over it; and after the performance of
some minor rites, the funeral train proceeds
to the burial-ground.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> When
within the tomb a singular ceremony is
performed by a person called “the instructor
of the dead;” who, sitting before
it, speaks to the corpse as if it were
a living person, saying, that there will
come two angels who will ask certain
questions, which he also tells the body
how to answer. The two angels are
supposed to visit the dead on the succeeding
night, when the soul will depart and
the body be tortured for its sins. After
burial, prayers are recited and certain
forms gone through by the relatives, to
facilitate the entrance of the deceased
<span class="pageno">169</span>
into paradise. Wailers are sometimes
hired at funerals, to make loud lamentations;
but in the case of a <em>welee</em>, or reputed
saint, these mournings are turned
into cries of joy at the release of the
pious man from this world, to the world
of happiness; to which it is believed he
has certainly departed.</p>

<p>The religious <em>superstitions</em> of the
Egyptians present a remarkable feature
in their character; as many of them are
not only believed in by the learned, but
are sanctioned by the Koran. The principal
of these is the belief in genii, a
class of spirits who play so prominent a
part in the “Arabian Nights Entertainments.”
These supernatural beings are
supposed to hold a sort of middle rank
between angels and men&mdash;&#8203;to be created
of fire, capable of assuming any form,
and of becoming invisible. They are
presumed to inhabit rivers, ruined houses,
wells, baths, ovens, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p class="center sc lowercase">TINGING THE EYES.</p>

<p>It is a common practice with ladies in
Egypt as in Persia, to tinge their eyes
with a black powder, called <em>khol</em>. This
seems to have been an ancient practice,
for vessels containing this powder have
been found in the tombs. The hands
and feet are also tinged with a decoction
of the henna tree, a kind of privet,
which imparts an orange hue. Women
of the lower classes mark their bodies
with a blue tint, like that used by sailors
in tattooing their wrists and arms.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Pictures of Various Nations.</h3>

<p class="p2 center ls">CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="center ls">MEXICO.</p>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">S<span class="sc">outh-west</span> of the United States is the
country of <span class="place">Mexico</span>. Till within a
few years, it was a Spanish colony;
but is now independent.</p>

<p>In Mexico there are <em>seven</em> kinds of
people: 1. <span class="title">Whites</span>, born in Europe; 2.
<span class="title">Creoles</span>, born of Spanish parents in
America; 3. <span class="title">Mestizoes</span>, or descendants
of Whites and Indians; 4. <span class="title">Mulattoes</span>,
sprung from Whites and Negroes; 5.
<span class="title">Zambas</span>, the offspring of Indians and
Negroes; 6. <span class="title">Indians</span>, who are the copper-colored
native race; and 7. <span class="title">African
Negroes</span>.</p>

<p>The Mexicans are of good <em>stature</em>,
well proportioned, and so free from personal
defects, that there is scarcely upon
the earth a nation, in which fewer deformed
persons are to be met with. Their
skin is of a copper-color; and they have
good complexions, narrow foreheads,
black eyes, white, firm, regular teeth,
and thick, glossy, black hair.</p>

<p>Some of the ladies are said to be very
beautiful; but they have one practice,
which is very disgusting&mdash;&#8203;that of <em>smoking
cigars</em>. They carry their cigars in
a gold, or silver case, suspended by a
ribbon at their side; and as soon as one
cigar is exhausted, another is lighted;
and they only cease to smoke, when they
eat or sleep.</p>

<p>It is said that the Mexicans are moderate
in eating; yet one would think
they must eat a great deal, as they have
eight meals a day. This I suppose,
however, is only among the higher classes.
Chocolate is a favorite beverage,
but if they eat little, they drink much.
Indeed, drunkenness is so common, that
in the city of Mexico, the police send
round <em>tumbrils</em>, or carts, to collect such
as are found stretched in the streets.</p>

<p>The senses of these people are very
acute, especially that of sight, which
they enjoy to old age, unimpaired. Their
constitutions are naturally sound; and,
though most of them die of severe diseases,
it is not uncommon for them to attain
to the age of a hundred years.</p>

<p>The Mexicans have good understandings;
but education among them is not
very general. They are said not to be
as passionate as the people of some other
countries. They are slow, and very
persevering in respect to works, which
require time. They are generous and disinterested.
They set but little value upon
gold. The Spanish inhabitants dress
very expensively. They generally wear
silks, and adorn their hats with belts of
gold, and roses of diamonds. Even
some of the slaves have bracelets, and
necklaces of gold, silver, pearls, and
gems.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic is the established
religion. The natives retain many
of their superstitious notions and practices.
When one of them dies, the deceased
has a jug of water given him,
and pieces of paper, with directions
where to go. At the same time, a little
dog, or some other domestic animal, is
killed, to accompany the deceased on his
journey, to the invisible world. The
corpse and the animal are now burned,
and the ashes placed in an earthen pot,
which is buried in a deep ditch.</p>

<p class="center ls"><span class="pageno">171</span>
BRAZIL.</p>

<p>Before we speak of the inhabitants of
Brazil, however, we shall say a word or
two of the country. Scarcely a finer
country is to be found on the globe. Its
climate is healthful; its soil fertile; its
scenery charming, and even romantic;
thick forests crown its hills, and perpetual
verdure adorns its valleys; noble
rivers pass in every direction, and the
richest tropical fruits abound in every
quarter. Brazil also is famous for its
gold and diamonds. Until recently, the
country belonged to the king of Portugal;
but it is now independent. The Roman
Catholic is the established religion.</p>

<p>The European settlers are generally
gay and fond of pleasure. The men
generally wear cloaks and swords. The
ladies have fine dark eyes, and expressive
countenances. They adorn their
heads with tresses, tied with ribbons and
flowers. The labor of this class of persons
is chiefly performed by slaves.</p>

<p>If you go into the country, but not into
the mining districts, you will find the
people living in small mud cottages, covered
with tiles or leaves. The people
here use no knives or forks; and but
few have tables. They eat their meals,
squatting on the ground, with dishes,
bowls or gourds, placed in the centre.
The people dress in a slovenly and mean
manner, but the women more so than the
men.</p>

<p>In the mining districts, the inhabitants
are still more degraded. You may
indeed see cups, coffee-pots, wash-basins,
and the like, all of silver; but other
things, food, dress, and manner of living,
by no means correspond.</p>

<p>The native Indians of Brazil are divided
into numerous tribes, and speak different
languages; but they all agree in
wearing few clothes. Many are entirely
naked. They are of a copper-color,
with long, coarse, black hair; but, like
the more northern Indians, they are destitute
of beards. They are a strong,
lively, and gay race of people. Few
diseases are known among them. They
delight in feasting and dancing, both of
which they carry to excess.</p>

<p>Their huts are made of the branches
of trees, and covered with palm leaves.
Their articles of furniture are few and
simple. Their weapons of war are
bows, arrows, and wooden clubs. The
flesh of monkeys is their principal animal
food. This they so prepare, that at
the same time it is roasted, it is blackened
with smoke. A monkey roasted
by a Brazilian, would frighten an American:
or if it did not frighten, it would
disgust him, for it is always roasted with
its head on, and in a sitting posture.</p>

<p class="center ls">PERU.</p>

<p>To the west of Brazil, lies Peru; and
hither we shall now conduct our readers,
to take a view of the inhabitants of
that country.</p>

<p>We must first tell them, however, a
few words of the country itself. Peru
is a hot and barren country. It is barren,
because it seldom rains there. It
has many dreary deserts. The lofty
Andes pass through, and divide it. It
abounds in gold, and silver, and mercury,
or quicksilver. Here, too, is found
Peruvian bark, which is so much used in
this, and other parts of the world.</p>

<p>Peru is a large country; and yet it
has but about a million and a half of inhabitants.
<span class="pageno">172</span>
They consist of <span class="title">Creoles</span>, <span class="title">Mestizoes</span>,
and <span class="title">Indians</span>, or natives of the
country. The <span class="title">Creoles</span> are natives of
Spanish descent. They are well made,
and of good stature, with lively, agreeable
countenances. The <span class="title">Mestizoes</span> are a
mixed race. They are, also, generally
well made, very robust, and quite tall.</p>

<p>By far the greater part of the inhabitants
of Peru are <span class="title">Indians</span>; but they are
not now what they once were. Many
years ago, the Spaniards conquered
them. At that time, they were a rich
and flourishing people. They understood
several of the arts, and many of
them lived in a style of magnificence.</p>

<p>At that time, gold was so common
among them, that they used it, as we use
iron and brass. Their sovereigns were
called <span class="title">Incas</span>. They believed the sun to
be a god, and worshipped it as such. The
glory of their former days has, however,
passed away. They are now almost
savages. They are well proportioned,
and even strong; but are generally low
in stature, and some of them remarkably
so. They have deep black hair, which
is thick, long, harsh and coarse, like
that of a horse. The men wear theirs
loose, but the women plait theirs behind
with a ribbon. They set great value
upon their hair; the greatest insult which
can be offered to either sex, is to cut it
off; and when this is done by way of
punishment, they never forgive the disgrace
put upon them.</p>

<p>Their dress consists of white cotton
drawers, reaching to the calf of the leg,
loose, and edged with lace. Instead of
a shirt, they wear a black cotton frock,
in the form of a sack, with two openings
for the arms, and a third for the head to
pass through; over this, they throw a
kind of cloak, and cover the head with
a hat.</p>

<p>This dress they never put off, even
when they sleep. Some of the richer
class distinguish themselves by the fineness
of their drawers, and wear shirts
with lace four or five inches broad, fastened
round the neck like a ruff. Though
they wear no stockings, they have silver
or gold buckles in their shoes; and their
cloak, which is of fine cloth, is often
adorned with gold or silver lace.</p>

<p class="center"><cite>The adventure of the monkeys concluded&mdash;&#8203;strange
animals&mdash;&#8203;weariness, despair&mdash;&#8203;a terrible incident.</cite></p>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">M<span class="sc">y</span> readers can hardly imagine the bewildered
state of my mind, occasioned
by the scenes described in
my last chapter. The little apes,
who grinned, chattered, frisked, and frolicked
in the moonlight around me, appeared
like so many fantastic sprites, and
I could scarcely believe that it was not
all a dream. Never shall I forget some
of their quizzical countenances and grotesque
gestures, as they peeped at me
between the branches of the trees. After
they had hung around me for several
minutes, one of them uttered a shrill cry,
and with many a leap, and jirk, and
bound, they disappeared. They seemed
to run along upon the trees, passing
from the branches of one to another, as
easily as a rabbit upon the solid ground.</p>

<p>They were indeed supplied with limbs
to accomplish this. They had not only
four hands, but they were furnished with
a tail, which seemed amazingly convenient
and useful. Never was any instrument
employed with more dexterity
and success. They wound it around
the limbs of the trees, where they hung
suspended, or swung from branch to
branch. When they were travelling
upon the giddy heights of the forests,
they held it erect, in order to keep them
steady, thus using it as a rope-dancer
does his balance pole.</p>

<p>At this time I knew very little about
these creatures, but I afterwards learned
that the forests of Guiana, as well as
other warm parts of South America,
abound in various kinds of monkeys, and
that the species who made me the nocturnal
visit I have described, are called <dfn>howlers</dfn>.
They are particularly noisy at
night, and make the forests ring with
their elvish din. It is common for one
of them to mount a tree, and seem to address
<span class="pageno">174</span>
the assembled group around him,
embellishing his discourse with the most
extraordinary grimaces, gestures, and
contortions. One can hardly look upon
a scene of this sort, and not feel it to be
a sort of satire upon human oratory.</p>

<p>I did not close my eyes again that
night. Morning at last came, and I attempted
to grope my way back through
the thickets, to the path I had lost. But
I was encompassed by lofty forests, and
my mind was in some degree bewildered,
I rambled about the whole day, and
at night found myself at the precise spot
from which I had started in the morning.</p>

<p>My heart was now full. The prospect
of perishing in the wilderness, was
before me; I had eaten the last morsel
of food that remained in my wallet; it
seemed impossible, therefore, that I should
escape. The thoughts of never again
seeing my mother and my home&mdash;&#8203;of
dying without a friend at my side, and
leaving my form to be torn limb from
limb, by wild beasts, all rushed upon me
with frightful force, and for a few moments,
I gave way to despair.</p>

<p>But these feelings gradually subsided,
and though no situation could be more
hopeless than mine, still, hope revived,
and I determined to make another effort
the next morning, to effect my escape.
Having formed this resolution, I stretched
myself out upon the ground and fell
asleep, and nothing remarkable occurred
during the night. At early dawn, I
arose, and set forward with the determination
of being more wary than before,
in order to avoid a similar result.
I was very hungry, but I soon found
some berries, which I ventured to eat,
though I was not sure that they were
wholesome. I pushed forward, as I imagined,
in a direct line toward the path.
But when one’s head is turned, south
seems north, and north south&mdash;&#8203;so that a
great part of the day, I travelled in the
direction opposite to that which I intended
to follow.</p>

<p>Toward evening, I came in sight of a
lake, and as I was exceedingly thirsty, I
approached it. It was encircled with
tall trees and thickly matted shrubbery,
except on the side where I was. Here
was a little opening, and as I came to
the edge of the water, I was about to
stoop down and quench my thirst; but
what was my astonishment to behold before
me a huge beast, bearing a resemblance
to a large black hog. It was
completely in the water, but I could distinctly
see it walking on the bottom and
approaching the shore. Being not a little
alarmed at this strange apparition, I
ran hastily back from the lake, and concealed
myself in a thicket, at the distance
of several yards. My position
was such, however, as to command a
view of the water.</p>

<p>I could soon perceive an undulation
on its glassy surface, and shortly after
the bristly back of the animal became
visible. He leisurely come to the shore,
looked around, snuffed the air, a little
suspiciously, and then began to devour
the coarse herbage that grew along the
margin of the water. The whole aspect
of this creature was swinish, and
I should have set him down as one of
the hog family, but for two reasons.
He was twice as big as any specimen of
that race, I had ever seen; and he had
a long, flexible snout, which he used like
<span class="pageno">175</span>
an elephant’s trunk. I watched him
narrowly, and never have I seen a more
extraordinary looking creature. He
seemed, indeed, to be half hog and half
elephant, though his manners resembled
the former, rather than the latter. He
seemed to feel perfectly at home, ate voraciously,
flourished his little tail, and
at last, sat down upon his rump, like a
tired dog.</p>

<p>I had now remained for half an hour
in my concealment, and being weary of
inaction, I rushed out from the thicket,
club in hand, and suddenly stood before
the beast. Never have I seen such a
gaze of stupid wonder, as the monster
at first exhibited. But he soon made up
his mind to retreat, and uttering a grunt
by way of exclamation, he plunged into
the water, and I saw him no more. I
afterwards learned that this animal is
common in the waters of South America,
and probably is known to most of
my readers, under the name of <dfn>tapir</dfn>.</p>

<p>Night soon followed this scene, and I
was obliged again to find a pillow beneath
the boughs of the forest; I slept
soundly, however, and again in the morning
began my rambles. My strength,
however, was impaired; my courage
was gradually ebbing away; still I continued
to roam about, making the best
effort I could for my deliverance. I was
not alone in the forest, for innumerable
parrots were chattering among the
branches of the trees, and birds of many
forms and hues, were glancing through
the air, or reposing in the leafy shade of
the wilderness.</p>

<p>I frequently met with monkeys, skipping
from tree to tree, and as they grinned
at me from above, I could fancy that
there was a sneering and malicious expression
in their faces, as if they understood
and rejoiced in my forlorn condition.
I once saw an animal bounding
along upon the ground, which greatly
resembled a raccoon, and a momentary
flash of pleasure came over my bosom,
at being thus reminded of a creature

with which I was familiar in my native
woods. But I soon perceived that the
animal had a longer tail and snout than
the raccoon. He speedily bounded up
a tree, and coiling his tail around one of
the branches, looked down upon me with
a gaze of curious wonder. I learned
that this creature was the <dfn>coaiti</dfn>; an animal
which is famous for eating up his
own tail!</p>

<p>Another and another day followed, my
strength and spirits gradually failing beneath
the efforts I was making, particularly
as the food I procured, consisting
wholly of berries, seemed to give me
but little sustenance. It was, I believe,
on the sixth day after I had wandered
from my path, that I sat down, overpowered
with heat, exhaustion, and despair.
I felt that my final hour was come&mdash;&#8203;that
I had found my resting place, and that I
must prepare in solitude to die. The
anguish of my feelings was not so great
as might have been imagined&mdash;&#8203;I was
worn out both in body and mind, and
was contemplating my release, if not
with satisfaction, at least with some degree
of composure, when a fearful spectacle
arrested my attention.</p>

<p>At the distance of about thirty feet,
lay an object, which at first, I had taken
to be the fallen branch of a tree. But
its dull, earthy colors, gradually changed
to the most brilliant hues; its relaxed
and flattened form, became rigid, rounded,
and curved. Its head rose with a
slow motion, and I could now perceive
that it was an enormous serpent, gliding
with a noiseless motion towards me. Its
eye was fixed upon me with a glassy
and terrific stare; its jaws were expanded;
its tongue brandished, ready to strike
the fatal blow. I had sufficient recollection
to know that this must be an anaconda,
and I expected the next instant
to be crushed in its folds. The thought
was too horrible to be endured. I felt a
faintness come over me, and while a
rushing sound filled my ears, my senses
departed.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Old Man in the Corner.</h3>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Number Six">NO. VI.</abbr></p>

<p class="center ls">PETER AND THE PIG.</p>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">here</span> was once a youth, who being
born in poverty, was brought up to
labor for his living. But being of
an indolent turn, he felt this to be a
great hardship. He was also as unwilling
to study his books, as he was to
perform other tasks. He hated all exertion;
and seemed indeed to think that
toil was the only curse, and idleness the
only bliss. If he was not the same
youth, who, when asked what he deemed
the highest state of happiness, replied&mdash;“swinging
on a gate, with one’s mouth
full of molasses candy,”&mdash;he was still,
of much the same way of thinking.</p>

<p>Now lazy Peter, as he was called,
went one day to feed the pig. The animal
<span class="pageno">177</span>
was very fat, and even when he heard
the corn rattle into his trough, he only
uttered a kind of affected grunt, pricked
up his ears, wagged his tail, and kept his
place. Peter looked into the stye, and beheld
with unaffected admiration, the luxurious
beast, imbedded in straw, and too
happy in the enjoyment of his digestion
and repose, even to get up and eat. “This
is the perfection of comfort,”&mdash;said Peter
to himself. “How pleasant it must
be to have nothing to do, but to eat and
sleep; no chores to do; no boots and
shoes to put on; no jackets and trowsers
to button up; no musty books to learn;
no Emerson’s Arithmetic to make one’s
head muzzy; no awful looking schoolmaster,
whose very countenance makes
one’s stomach ache, to watch over him;
no sharp voice to call him at 5 o’clock in
the morning! No, no&mdash;&#8203;he eats and sleeps
and sleeps and eats&mdash;&#8203;gets up and goes
to bed just as he pleases. Really, I half
wish I was a pig!”</p>

<p>Thus mused lazy Peter&mdash;&#8203;while he
rested his chin upon the edge of the pig-stye,
and gazed with dreamy eyes upon
the lord of the manor. At length, urged
by a sense of imperious necessity&mdash;&#8203;for
the idea of duty, had not yet taken possession
of his head&mdash;&#8203;he tore himself
away from these agreeable contemplations.</p>

<p>At night Peter went to bed as usual,
but the scene of the pig-stye had made
such an impression upon his mind, that
it stole in among the visions of his sleep.
He dreamed that he was sauntering along
upon a highway, and bound upon some
long journey. Weary at length, he sat
down and began to grumble at the necessity
of travelling such a distance, and
over such a tiresome road. While he
was thus occupied, a Fairy came to him,
and said&mdash;“Peter, I have heard your
complaints, and have come to relieve
them! You think it hard to travel this
road, though its borders are decorated
with flowers; though it leads through delightful
regions, and finally terminates
in a happy home, where friends gather
around to minister to every want and
gratify every desire. Your difficulty is,
that you must take the trouble to pick
the flowers, to visit these happy regions,
to travel to this final home of peace.
Well, you shall have your way: you
want idleness, and deem that this is
bliss. I have a stye, in which is the fattest
pig you ever saw: you shall be his
companion, share his bed and board, and
thus find the fulfilment of your wishes!”</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, Peter accepted
the offer, and was soon domesticated
in the stye. For a time, he enjoyed himself
to the utmost: to be sure the perfume
of the place offended him a little
at first&mdash;&#8203;but the luxury of having nothing
to do but to eat and sleep, prevailed
over every other feeling, and he deemed
himself perfectly happy.</p>

<p>Thus time rolled on&mdash;&#8203;until one night
he chanced to hear certain ominous preparations
going on outside of the stye.
He heard the rolling of a large tub, and
chanced to hear the mistress of the
place give directions to a man to butcher
her two pigs the next morning. “Two
pigs!” said Peter to himself&mdash;“and so
I am one of them: but I’ll give them
the slip!” He waited till all around was
quiet, and then attempted to rise, for the
purpose of making his escape. But alas
he was so fat and unwieldly, and the
<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="pageno">178</span>
fence was so high, that he could by no
possibility get out of the pen. And
there was one thing, which struck him
with absolute horror: he now perceived
that he had four legs&mdash;&#8203;cloven feet, a long
snout, and a tail! Nor was this all&mdash;&#8203;long
wiry bristles stood up along his
back&mdash;&#8203;his sides were coated with coarse
hair, and while he tugged to get out of
his prison, he grunted like his companion.
“I am, at last, a pig then!” said Peter;
“and yet, I am not altogether a pig.
I know more than this lazy beast by my
side; I know what is to happen to-morrow,
and while he is at rest, I am in an
agony of fear. I wish I were really a
pig, for then I should know no fear, and
the butcher’s knife would finish me. But
it is really horrible to have the mind of
a human being, and the body and habits
of a hog.”</p>

<p>Poor Peter in the agony of his dream
made a great outcry, but it was like the
squealing of a pig; the fairy heard it,
however, and came at the call. “What
is the matter?”&mdash;said she. “Let me
out! let me out!” said Peter in his frenzy.
“I can’t let you out,” said the fairy:
“you weigh at least fifteen score, and beside,
you are a pig, now; for you must
know that if a human being adopts swinish
habits and keeps swinish company,
he gradually becomes assimilated to the
brute he imitates. But there is one difference:
the pig, though he enjoys indolence,
is able to do so, only because
of his ignorance. He has no mind which
paints higher and nobler enjoyments;
no desire of long life; no looking forward
to the future; no sense of right
and wrong; no conscience to disturb him.
It is otherwise with you. You have a
mind, and though you may abuse it, you
cannot annihilate it. It is a lamp&mdash;&#8203;it
may become dim for a time, but you
cannot put it out. It will burn forever,
and will forever show you, and make
you feel the degradation you have
reached, and the happiness you have
lost.” Thus saying, the fairy departed.</p>

<p>It is not possible to tell the agony of
the dreamer; he now saw his folly, and
bitterly lamented it. But at last, in his
vision, the morning came. He heard
the hot, hissing water poured into the tub,
to scald off his hair; he heard a lively
whetting of knives, and at last saw the
goggling eyes of the butcher, taking a
look over the edge of the pig-stye. His
agony was beyond bounds; he uttered
a piercing shriek, and in the paroxysm
of his distress, he awoke. It was, however,
a lucky dream, for the youth took
warning by it, and conquering his indolence,
he became industrious, and grew
up a prosperous and happy man.</p>

<p>Reader, if thou art given to indolence,
take heed by Peter’s dream; and like
him, turn from the error of thy ways.
Deem not that indolence is bliss&mdash;&#8203;but
believe me&mdash;&#8203;the ways of industry are
ways of pleasantness, and her paths lead
to peace.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Five-Dollar Bill.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">he</span> following story has been published
in many of the newspapers, but it is
so good, that we give it a place in
our columns. It not only shows how
proper and necessary it is to pay small
accounts, but it shows the use of money.
What a wonderful thing, that little pieces
of paper may perform such important
offices in society, as we see that they
do, by the story of the “Five-Dollar
Bill.”</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>“Sir, if you please, boss would like
you to pay this bill to-day,” said, for the
tenth time, a half-grown boy in a dirty
jacket, to a lawyer named Peter Chancery,
and whose office was in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The attorney at length turned round
and stared the boy full in the face, as
if he had been some newly discovered
specimen of zoology, gave a long whistle,
thrust his inky finger first into one pocket
and then into the other of his black
cloth vest, and then gave another long
whistle and completed his stare at the
boy’s face.</p>

<p>“Ho, ha, hum! that bill, eh?” and the
legal young gentleman extended the tips
of his fingers towards the well worn bit
of paper, and daintily opening it, looked
at its contents.</p>

<p>“Hum! for capping and heel-tapping,
six shillings&mdash;&#8203;for foxing, ten and sixpence,
and other sundries, eh! So your
master wants me to settle this bill, eh?”
repeated the man of briefs.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. This is the nineteenth time
I have come for it, and I intend to knock
off at twenty and call it half a day.”</p>

<p>“You’re an impudent boy.”</p>

<p>“I’s always impudent to lawyers, coz
I can’t help it&mdash;&#8203;it’s catchin’.”</p>

<p>“Your eye-teeth are cut, I see!”</p>

<p>“That’s what boss sent <em>me</em> for, instead
o’ the ’prentices as was gettin’ their teeth
cut. I cut mine at nine months old, with
a hand-saw. Boss says if you don’t pay
that bill he’ll sue you.”</p>

<p>“Sue <em>me</em>? I’m a lawyer!”</p>

<p>“It’s no matter for that! Lawyer or
no lawyer, boss declares he’ll do it&mdash;&#8203;so
fork over!”</p>

<p>“Declares he’ll sue me?”</p>

<p>“As true as there’s another lawyer in
all Filadelphy.”</p>

<p>“That would be bad!”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Silence, you vagabond. I suppose
I must pay this,” muttered the attorney
to himself. “It’s not my plan to pay
these small bills! What is a lawyer’s
profession good for, if he can’t get clear
paying his own bills? He’ll sue me!
’Tis just five dollars! It comes hard,
and he don’t want the money! His boy
could have earned it in the time he has
been sending him to me to dun for it.&mdash;&#8203;So
your master will sue for it if I don’t
pay?”</p>

<p>“He says he will do it, and charge you
a new pair o’ shoes for me.”</p>

<p>“Hark’ee. I can’t pay to-day; and so
if your boss will sue, just be so kind as to
ask him to employ me as his attorney.”</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ll issue the writ, have it
served, and then you see I shall put the
costs into my own pocket, instead of seeing
them go into another lawyer’s. So
you see if I have to pay the bill I’ll make
the costs. Capital idea.”</p>

<p><span class="pageno">180</span>
The boy scratched his head a while,
as if striving to comprehend this “capital
idea,” and then shook it doubtingly.
“I don’t know about this; it looks tricky.
I’ll ask boss though, if as how you say
you won’t pay it no how without being
sued.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather be sued if he’ll employ
me, boy!”</p>

<p>“But who’s to pay them costs&mdash;&#8203;the
boss?”</p>

<p>The lawyer looked at once very serious,
and then gave another of those long
whistles peculiar to him.</p>

<p>“Well, I am a sensible man, truly!
My anxiety to get the costs of the suit
blinded me to the fact that they had got
to come out of one of my own pockets
before they could be safely put into the
other pocket! Ah; well, my boy, I suppose
I must pay. Here is a five-dollar
bill. Is it receipted?&mdash;&#8203;it is so dirty and
greasy I can’t see.”</p>

<p>“It was nice and clean three months
ago when boss gin it to me, and the
writin’ shined like Knapp’s Blackin’&mdash;&#8203;it’s
torn so of a dunnin’ so much.”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s your money,” said the
man of law, taking a solitary five-dollar
note from his watch fob; “now, tell your
master, Mr. Last, that if he has any other
accounts he wants sued, I will attend to
them with the greatest pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Thank’ee,” answered the boy, pocketing
five, “but you is the only regular
dunnin’ customer boss has, and now
you’ve paid up, he hasn’t none but cash
folks. Good day to you.”</p>

<p>“Now there goes a five-dollar note
that will do that fellow, Last, no good.
I am in great want of it, but he is not.
It is a five thrown away. It wouldn’t
have left my pocket but that I was sure
his patience was worn out, and that costs
would come out of it. I like to have
costs, but I don’t think a lawyer has anything
to do with paying them.”</p>

<p>As Peter Chancery, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> did not believe
in his own mind that paying his
debt to Mr. Last was to be of any benefit
to him, and was of opinion that it was
“money thrown away,” let us follow the
fate of this five-dollar bill through the
day.</p>

<p>“He has paid,” said the boy, placing
the five-dollar bill in his master’s hand.</p>

<p>“Well, I am glad of it,” answered Mr.
Last, surveying the bank-note through
his glasses; “and it’s a current bill, too.
Now run with it and pay Mr. Furnace
the five dollars I borrowed of him yesterday,
and said I would return to-morrow.
But I’ll pay it now.”</p>

<p>“Ah my lad, come just in time,” said
Furnace, as the boy delivered his errand
and the note. “I was just wondering
where I could get five dollars to pay a
bill which is due to-day. Here, John,”
he called to one of his apprentices, “put
on your hat and take this money to
Captain O’Brien, and tell him I came
within one of disappointing him, when
some money came in I didn’t expect.”</p>

<p>Captain O’Brien was on board his
schooner at the next wharf, and with
him was a seaman, with his hat in his
hand, looking very gloomy as he spoke
with him.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, my man, I can’t pay you&mdash;&#8203;but
I have just raised and scraped the
last dollar I can get above water to pay
my insurance money to-day, and have
not a copper left in my pocket to jingle,
but keys and old nails.”</p>

<p><span class="pageno">181</span>
“But I am very much in need, sir;
my wife is ailing, and my family are in
want of a good many things just now,
and I got several articles at the store
expecting to get money of you to take
’em up as I went along home. We han’t
in the house no flour, no tea, nor&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, my lad, I’m sorry. You must
come to-morrow. I can’t help you unless
I sell the coat off my back, or pawn the
schooner’s kedge. Nobody pays me.”</p>

<p>The sailor, who had come to get an
advance of wages, turned away sorrowful,
when the apprentice boy came up
and said, in his hearing, “Here, sir, is
five dollars Mr. Furnace owes you. He
says when he told you he couldn’t pay
your bill to-day, he didn’t expect some
money that came in after you left the
shop.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s my fine boy! Here, Jack,
take this five-dollar bill, and come Saturday
and get the balance of your wages.”</p>

<p>The seaman, with a joyful bound, took
the bill, and touching his hat, sprung
with a light heart on shore and hastened
to the store where he had already selected
the comforts and necessaries which
his family stood so much in need of.</p>

<p>As he entered, a poor woman was
trying to prevail on the store-keeper to
settle a demand for making his shirts.</p>

<p>“You had better take it out of the
store, Mrs. Conway,” he said to her;
“really, I have not taken half the amount
of your bill to-day, and don’t expect to.
I have to charge every thing, and no
money comes in.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do without it,” answered the
woman: “my daughter is very ill, and
in want of every comfort; I am out of
fire-wood, and indeed I want many things
which I have depended on this money
to get.”</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry, Mrs. Conway,” said
the store-keeper, looking into his money-drawer;
“I have not five shillings here,
and your bill is five dollars and ninepence.”</p>

<p>The poor woman thought of her invalid
child, and wrung her hands.</p>

<p>“A sailor was here a while ago and
selected full five dollars’ worth of articles,
here on the counter, and went away
to get his wages to pay for them; but
I question if he comes back. If he does
and pays for them, you shall have your
money, madam.”</p>

<p>At this instant Jack made his appearance
in the door.</p>

<p>“Well, ship-mate,” he cried, in a tone
much more elevated than when he was
discovered speaking with the captain;
“well, my hearty, hand over my freight.
I’ve got the document, so give us possession!”
and displaying his five-dollar
note, he laid hold of his purchases.</p>

<p>The store-keeper, examining and seeing
the note was a good one, bade him
take them with him, and then sighing,
as he took another and last look at the
bill, he handed it to the poor widow,
who, with a joyful smile, received it
from him and hastened from the store.</p>

<p>In a low and very humble tenement,
near the water, was a family of poor
children, whose appearance exhibited the
utmost destitution. On a cot-bed near,
lay a poor woman, ill and emaciated.
The door opened, and a man in coarse,
patched garments entered with a wood-saw
and cross, and laid them down by
the door side, and approached the bed.</p>

<p>“Are you any better, dear?” he asked
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pageno">182</span>
in a rough voice, but in the kindest
tones.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;&#8203;have you found work? If you
could get me a little nourishing food, I
should regain my strength.”</p>

<p>The man gazed upon her pale face a
moment, and again taking up his saw
and cross, went out. He had not gone
far before a woman met him, and said
she wished him to follow her and saw
some wood for her. His heart bounded
with hope and gratitude, and he went
after her to her dwelling, an abode but
little better than his own for its poverty,
yet wearing an air of comfort. He sawed
the wood, split and piled it, and received
six shillings, with which he hastened to
a store for necessaries for his sick wife,
and then hurried home to gladden her
heart with the delicacies he had provided.
Till now he had had no work for four
days, and his family had been starving;
and from this day his wife got better and
was at length restored to her family and
to health, from a state of weakness to
which another day’s continuance would
probably have proved fatal.</p>

<p>These six shillings, which did so much
good, were paid him by the poor woman
from the five dollars she had received
from the store-keeper, and which the
sailor had paid him. The poor woman’s
daughter, also, was revived and ultimately
restored to health; and was lately
married to a young man who had been
three years absent and returned <em>true to
his troth</em>. But for the five dollars which
had been so instrumental in her recovery,
he might have returned to be told
that she, whose memory had so long
been the polar star of his heart, had perished.</p>

<p>So much good did the five-dollar bill
do which Peter Chancery, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> so reluctantly
paid to Mr. Last’s apprentice boy,
though little credit is due to this legal
gentleman for the results that followed.
It is thus that Providence often makes
bad men instruments of good to others.
Let this story lead those who think a
“small bill” can stand because it is a
small bill, remember how much good a
five-dollar bill has done in one single day&mdash;&#8203;and
that in paying a <em>series</em> of twenty
bills, they may dispense good to hundreds
around them.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Lark.</h3>

<p class="center small">A GERMAN ALLEGORY.</p>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">I<span class="sc">n</span> the balmy morning of a spring day,
a farmer walked with his son into the
field. The cool morning wind played
with the silver locks of the old man,
and lifted the blooming stems of the
field, so that they appeared like a cloud
over the waving grain.</p>

<p>And the old man said, “Behold how
active nature is for our good! With the
same breath which cools our cheeks, she
makes our fields fruitful, so that our
barns are filled.</p>

<p>“Eighty years have I witnessed this,
and still it is as pleasing to me as though
I saw it to-day for the first time. It
may easily be the last! For have I not
reached the limit of human life!”</p>

<p>Thus the old man spake. Then the
son pressed his hand and was grieved in
his heart.</p>

<p>But the father said, “Why do you
mourn? Behold, my day is ended, and
my evening has come. If a new morning
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pageno">183</span>
is to break upon me, it must first be
night. But it will appear to me like a
night of summer, cool, and lovely, when
the evening twilight melts into the twilight
of morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh my father,” said the son, “how
can you speak so composedly of that,
which will be to us the cause of severe
affliction? You have given me an emblem
of your death. Oh give me an
emblem of your life, my father!”</p>

<p>Then the old man replied, “That I
can easily do. For the life of a farmer
is simple, like nature, which surrounds
him. See the lark yonder; do you observe
how it arises out of the grain-field
singing! It does not soar so near the
farmer for nothing! For it is the emblem
of his life.</p>

<p>“Behold, it is born and matured in the
lap of maternal earth, and feeds itself in
the nourishing furrow. Among the waving
stems it builds its nest and hatches
its eggs, and takes care of its young.
And the animating exhalations of the
ground and the green field strengthen
its wings, and the voice of its bosom.
But now it arises towards heaven, and
looks down from above on the stems and
grain, and the tender mother, and upwards
at the light, which rears the stems,
and in the cloud, which sends dew and
rain on the earth. As soon as morning
begins to dawn, it is on the wing, to salute
the early messenger of approaching day.
And when the evening sun is sinking
below the horizon, it rises again to drink
of his last celestial beams. Thus it lives
a two-fold life, the one silently in the
still shade of the nourishing furrow and
the green stems, and the other, singing
in the bright regions of a higher world
of light. But its two-fold life is only one.
For behold, it rises only to descend, and
descends only to rise again!”</p>

<p>Thus the old man spake. And the
son fervently pressed the hand of his
father, and said, “Ah yes, my father,
such has been your life! Oh, may it be
a source of joy to us for a long time to
come!”</p>

<p>Thereupon the old man replied, “The
clod is too heavy for me! Why do you
envy me the undivided life of pure harmony
and brighter light?</p>

<p>“The day is sultry. Come, let us
return home.”</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Battle between a Rat and a Crab.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">he</span> following incident is related in a
late English journal:</p>

<p>In the year 1812, a sailor in company
with several persons, at Sunderland,
a short time before, perceived a
crab which had wandered to the distance
of about three yards from the water side.
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pageno">185</span>
An old rat, on the look-out for food,
sprang from his lurking-place and seized
the crab, who, in return, raised his forcep
claws, and laid fast hold of the
assailant’s nose, who, when opportunity
offered, hastily retired, squeaking a doleful
chant, much surprised, no doubt, at
the unexpected reception he had experienced.</p>

<p>The crab, finding itself at liberty, retreated,
as speedily as crab could do,
towards its own element; but after a
short space of time, it was arrested in
its progress by Mr. Rat, who renewed
the contest, and experienced a second
rude embrace from his antagonist. The
rat, as before, retreated, bemoaning such
violent treatment. Frequent and severe
were the attacks; on view of his enemy,
the crab always prepared for action by
raising its fore claws in a threatening
attitude.</p>

<p>After a bloodless contest of half an
hour, the crab, though much exhausted,
had nearly reached the sea, when the
rat, almost despairing of conquest, made
a last and daring effort to overcome his
antagonist, and succeeded (to use the
seaman’s term) in capsizing his intended
victim, a situation of which the rat immediately
took advantage, seizing, like
an able general, the vanquished prey,
and dragging the creature by the hind
legs (proceeding backwards) into his
den. After a short interval, he made his
escape, and appeared to the spectators,
mutilated and deprived of most of the
small legs; the rat soon followed in pursuit
of the fugitive, and forced him back
to his den, where, no doubt, he regaled
his wife and family.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Bill and the Boys,</h3>

<p class="center small">OR WIT AND WEALTH.</p>

<p class="p2 dropcap negindent">A<span class="sc">s</span> we have finished Bill Keeler’s story
of the lottery ticket, we will now proceed
to relate another tale which was
told by one of the boys who belonged
to the story-telling circle of Salem, and
which we shall entitle Wit and Wealth.</p>

<p>A great many years ago, and in a far-off
country, there were two boys&mdash;&#8203;one of
them was the son of the king and bore the
name of Selim; the other was the child
of a poor man and was called Bazeen.</p>

<p>Selim was brought up in luxury and
permitted to have his own way. He was
dressed in the richest silks; his ears
were decorated with diamonds, and jewels
of great price glittered upon every
part of his person. He was surrounded
with servants, who were attentive to his
wishes, and prompt to gratify every passion
and caprice.</p>

<p>But while so much pains were taken
to amuse the young prince and minister
to his pleasures, his education in most
respects was neglected. He was instructed
in horsemanship, music, dancing
and military exercises, but he had
a contempt for books, and utterly refused
to learn to read. He seemed to think
it was enough to be a prince&mdash;&#8203;that by
birth he was superior to all others. He
made, indeed, a mistake common enough
among people of high fortune, in feeling
that the rank and condition in which he
was born gave him a right to claim superiority
in every respect over all around
him. He forgot that there is no royal
road to learning&mdash;&#8203;that the prince as well
as the plebeian must study to acquire
knowledge, and that a person with a full
<span class="pageno">186</span>
purse may be a pauper with respect to
brains.</p>

<p>Young Bazeen was very different from
all this. His father, as we have said,
was poor. He had no jewels with which
to decorate the person of his son, nor
could he do more in respect to dress than
to clothe him in the plainest attire. But
he had still the power of giving his
boy an education, for learning was little
prized in that country, and the schoolmaster
undertook the education of Bazeen
for a very small compensation.
Thus, the boy was taught the learning
of that day, and among other things was
made acquainted with several different
languages.</p>

<p>When the two youths we have described
were approaching the period of
manhood, they joined the army of their
country and went on an expedition
against a distant enemy. Bazeen was
attached to Selim’s corps, which consisted
of a troop of horse, and though a private
soldier, he attracted the notice of
the youthful prince. They at last met
the enemy, and their army being defeated
in the terrible engagement which
followed, they were both taken and carried
into captivity.</p>

<p>The appearance of Selim marked him
as a person of some consequence, and he
was therefore ordered into the presence
of the king whose soldiers had made
him prisoner. Bazeen accompanied him
as his attendant. The young prince had
taken care to decorate his person in the
most costly manner, expecting in this
way to dazzle the eyes of the monarch,
before whom he was to appear.</p>

<p>The two prisoners were soon led into
the presence of the sovereign. He received
the young prince graciously, and
began to ask him questions about the
battle, and the country from which he
came. But he soon perceived that Selim
was ill informed upon these subjects, and
that he was, in fact, deficient in intelligence
and observation. He then turned
his attention to Bazeen, and put nearly
the same questions to him that he had
done to Selim. Bazeen answered modestly,
and with some hesitation, doubting
whether it was proper to show himself
superior in knowledge to his royal
master. The monarch penetrated his
feelings, and commanded him to reply.
The youth was therefore forced to answer,
and soon showed himself to possess
a great deal of knowledge. “Bring
me a book!” said the king to one of his
servants. The book was brought and
handed to Selim; but he shook his
head disdainfully, and remarked that at
his father’s court, princes scorned the
drudgery of learning to read. “Such
tasks,” said he, “are reserved for our
slaves. Give the book to Bazeen, he can
read!”</p>

<p>The lip of the monarch curled, but
he did not speak. The book was handed
to Bazeen, and he read the passage that
was pointed out. “It is well,” said the
king, “and now hear my decree. Bazeen
shall be my secretary, for he has
learning; and his mind, which is the
noblest part of man, fits him to be the
companion of princes. Selim despises
learning, and shows that while the body&mdash;&#8203;the
inferior part&mdash;&#8203;is glittering with
jewels, he has still a base and grovelling
mind! Selim is at heart a slave, and
slavery shall be his doom. This is my
decree.”</p>

<p><span class="pageno">187</span>
The sentence of the king was put in
immediate execution. Bazeen was raised
to a high station in the palace, and Selim
was compelled to perform the meanest
offices of the household. But the former
was scarcely less unhappy than the latter.
He performed his duties faithfully,
but he did not enter heartily into the
service of a king who was the enemy of
his country. The condition of Selim was
also a constant source of misery to him.
He therefore entered into a scheme for
effecting the escape of his young master
and his own. In endeavoring to carry
this into effect, they were both detected
and thrown into prison.</p>

<p>It was some consolation to the two
youths that they were permitted to be
together, but after they had been confined
for several months, time hung heavily
on their hands. Their dungeon consisted
of a small room, with scarcely a ray of
light. Selim soon sunk into a miserable
state of despair. He was permitted to
retain his jewels, but how worthless
were they now! They seemed, indeed,
to mock his degradation, and even to
embitter his misery. But Bazeen had
jewels of another kind&mdash;&#8203;those of the
mind, which could even illuminate the
darkness, and were of inestimable value
even in the dungeon. They enabled
him to support his confinement; his
range of knowledge furnished him with
constant sources of thought, reflection
and emotion. He was thus not only able
to keep his own mind in a cheerful state,
but he often communicated the light of
his mind to that of his dejected companion.</p>

<p>A year had now passed, when at last
the jailer in making his rounds entered
the apartment, attended by a person
holding a lamp in one hand, and a scroll
in the other. The latter addressed the
prisoners as follows: “I am instructed
by the king, my master, to present to
you this writing, and he that can read it
is pardoned, and permitted to return to
his own country.” Upon this he held
out the paper, first to the prince and then
to Bazeen. The latter ran his eye over
it, but shook his head, saying “It is a
hard task you give us; we have been
confined in a dungeon for a year, and
now you bring us a light which dazzles
our eyes. Leave us the lamp for an
hour, and when we are accustomed to the
light, return and put us upon the trial.”</p>

<p>The messenger of the king acceded to
this proposition, and departed. As soon
as he was gone, Bazeen, who had read
the paper, told Selim the precise words
it contained. He made him repeat them
again and again, until they were fixed
in his memory.</p>

<p>At the time appointed the messenger
returned. Selim took the paper, and repeated
the words it contained, thus seeming
to read it accurately. He was therefore
released from the prison, and taking
leave of Bazeen, departed from the dungeon.
He was taken before the king,
where Bazeen also was summoned. “I
have heard the story of your wit,” said
he to the latter, “and you have used it
generously in behalf of your master.
He shall have his liberty, for I have
promised it; but you shall accompany
him. He may depart; but let him carry
with him the consciousness that wit is
better than wealth, and the mind infinitely
more worthy of decoration than the
person.”</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Blue Beard and his Castle.</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap unindent">T<span class="sc">he</span> ruins of the Chateau de la Verriere,
on the banks of the Erdre, in
the department of the Loire Inferieure,
are, according to the tradition
of the neighboring peasantry, those of
the castle of the celebrated Blue Beard,
the hero of the well known nursery tale.
This formidable personage, who is not
altogether a creature of fancy, was Giles
de Retz, who lived in the reign of Charles
VII., and was a vassal of John V., duke
of Bretagne. He was tried at Nantes,
on suspicion of having destroyed a number
of children, who had been seen to
enter the castle, and were never heard
of afterwards.</p>

<p>The bodies of several were afterwards
found, he having caused them to be put
to death to make use of their blood in
writing charms and forming incantations
to raise infernal spirits, by whose means
he believed, according to the horrible
superstitions of the times, that buried
treasures would be revealed to him. On
his trial he confessed the most horrible
acts of atrocity, and was sentenced to be
burnt alive; but the duke caused him to
be strangled before he was tied to the
stake. This execution took place December
25th, 1440, and a detailed account
of it is still preserved in a manuscript
in the archives of Nantes.</p>

<p><span class="sc">A Horse stung to death by Bees.</span>&mdash;We

bee-hive, a few days ago, when the
swarm set upon the horse and stung
him until he sunk down in the greatest
agony and immediately died. Before
he fell, Mr. Russell made every effort to
remove the horse, but the poor brute
seemed spellbound, and refused to stir.
The day was warm, and Mr. Russell

leaves. How sweet is the smell of the
sweetbriar after the rain! How pleasant
does the garden look! A few weeks
ago there were little signs of life anywhere,
but now every border is full of
flowers, and fresh buds are still showing
their heads above the ground. Among
the low green leaves, we see colors of
blue, and red, and yellow, and orange,
and purple. Where were these beautiful
flowers in winter? Were they dead?
They were buried, indeed, in the ground,
and their fair blossoms were not then
unfolded, but there was life in their roots.
There was life, too, in the seeds which
were sown a little while ago, though
they did not spring up till the rain and
sunshine came.</p>

<p>Your kind heavenly Father sends you
flowers, not only to teach you wisdom,
but to give you sweet and innocent
pleasure. So now, my little ones, enjoy
the sunshine, for it will soon pass away.
The clouds are gathering again. Look

into yellow balls, and let no innocent
joy of spring pass by you.&mdash;&#8203;<cite>English

<p class="center">AND HIS ANSWER.</p>

<p class="p2 quotesig"><span class="corresp">Belleville, Gloucester county, Va., <br />
March 26th, 1844.</span></p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Parley</span>:</p>

<p>I am very much interested in your little
book on the sun, moon, and stars; I understand
it very well. The last lesson I read
was about the centrifugal and centripetal forces.
I have read a good many of your books of
Asia, Africa, Europe, the Christmas Gift, and
your magazine.</p>

<p>I should like to have accompanied you in
your journeys on the terrestrial and celestial
globes; were you not afraid of being melted
in Mercury and freezing in Uranus? I think
I should have been.</p>

<p>I have lately been reading the history of Virginia,
which is the state in which I live. I think
it very interesting. It tells when the state was
first settled, and it gave me a great deal of information
about the colonies. I did not know
of Nathaniel Bacon, or the rebellion which he
caused, before I read the book, although he
lived and died within a few miles of our house.
His remains were buried in Petsworth church.
Nor did I know, before I read the history, that
Charles 2d’s coronation robe was woven in
Gloucester county.</p>

<p>You may be sure I was very glad to have a
knowledge of such facts. The Virginians were
very loyal subjects, and would have continued
so, had it not been for the manner in which
they were treated by the king and his parliament.</p>

<p>Are you a whig or a democrat? Mr. Parley,
do you think we shall ever have as good a president
as Washington? I fear not, but hope
we may. Mr. Parley, where did you acquire
so much information as you have given your
little readers? My brother, who went to Cambridge
College, says he has often passed your
house; if I had been in his place, I would have
stepped in and made your acquaintance. I am
for Mr. Clay.</p>

<p>I wish you would write a book on mythology.
I would like to know something more than I
do of the heathen gods. I have read a good
deal of them, but not by you. Your method
being so good to convey information, furnishes
a reason why I should like to read a book on
this subject by you. I have seen your geography,
and think it very good for youth; it gives
such a good description of the earth.</p>

<p class="p2 center">PETER PARLEY’S ANSWER.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="sc">My dear young Friend</span>:</p>

<p>Your kind letter, written in March last, was
received by me some weeks since; but I have
not been able to answer it till now. You
speak very pleasantly of my little books, and
tell me that they have given you a great deal
of instruction. I am glad to hear this, and I
shall be still more pleased to learn, that as they
have added to your stock of knowledge, and
increased your enjoyment, they have also shown
you, that our goodness ought to increase with
our learning. I shall at least indulge the belief
that it will prove so in your case, and that
you will thus, in after life&mdash;&#8203;show yourself worthy
of the name you bear.</p>

<p>You speak with great interest of Virginia&mdash;&#8203;and
this is right&mdash;&#8203;for it is your birth-place. It
is natural to love our native land, and this
love, which is called patriotism, is a virtuous
and praiseworthy sentiment. How many beautiful
and glorious actions have sprung from it!
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pageno">190</span>
What a noble spectacle does the life of Washington
present, who lived for his country! A
true patriot is indeed a great man, and commands
the admiration of the world. You
may be proud of a state that produced Washington,
but though I am a Yankee, he was my
countryman, and I am proud of him too.</p>

<p>You ask if I am a whig, or a democrat.
If Washington was a whig, so am I. I do
not know that, in all respects, we shall ever
again have so faultless a character to preside
over our nation; but I hope to see the next
president, whoever he may be, willing to
walk in his footsteps&mdash;&#8203;willing to imbibe his
spirit&mdash;&#8203;willing to set an example of patriotism
to the whole country and the whole world.
If Henry Clay is this kind of man&mdash;&#8203;and I am
told he is&mdash;&#8203;I shall rejoice to see him president.
They say he has a noble, generous, patriotic
heart&mdash;&#8203;and an excellent head too. This union
makes a great man. Without it no man can
be truly great.</p>

<p>I have hardly space to talk of politics, for you
know it is a mighty long-winded subject. The
best way is for you to call and see me, when
you visit Boston. I live in a brown house,
four miles from the city, and am ever glad to
see my young friends. I always have a plate
ready, somewhat in Virginia fashion, for my
juvenile visitors. If my table is not so bountifully
spread as yours, I will try to imitate that
warm-hearted hospitality for which Old Virginia
is famous. When you come, I will tell
you whether I am a whig or a democrat&mdash;&#8203;and
one thing you will find out&mdash;&#8203;and that is, that I
like a <em>clever fellow</em>, whatever his politics may
be. We will also, when you visit me, talk
over the affairs of Mercury and mythology. If
I do not tell you where I got all my knowledge,
I will try to satisfy you that a moderate stock
of learning, well employed, may do a great
deal of good in the world.</p>

guesses that the answer to the riddle of our
Quincy subscriber, is North America; and that

are several other correspondents, who send us

<p class="blockquote"><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;&#8203;I have received your Museum,
and I am perfectly delighted with it. I am
trying to get you more subscribers in our town,
and I know that when I show the late numbers
to some of the other little girls and boys, I shall
have some new subscribers for you. I take a
great deal of interest in your <em>puzzles</em>, and every
time that your Museum has some of them in
it, I sit down and try to solve them. Sometimes
I succeed, and sometimes I do not. I
write this to you because I see that you say in
your last, that you love to hear from your little
subscribers; and I am also encouraged to do
so, seeing that you published a letter from a
subscriber in Decatur, which is not very far
from this place. I have found the answer to
the Enigma of Frederick H. B. of Quincy;
and I also send one of my own, which you will
please publish if you think it deserves it. All
that I have now to add is, that you are not forgotten
in Georgia.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">Transcriber’s Note:</h4>

<p>This book was written in a period when many words had not become
standardized in their spelling. Words may have multiple spelling
variations or inconsistent hyphenation in the text. These have been
left unchanged unless indicated below.</p>

<p>Hyphenation of titles in the Table of Contents was adjusted to match
that of the text in the book.</p>

<p>Footnotes were renumbered sequentially and were moved to the
end of the book. Obvious printing errors, such as backwards, upside
down, partially or unprinted printed letters, were corrected. Final
stops missing at the end of sentences and abbreviations were added.
Duplicate letters at line endings or page breaks were removed.</p>

<p>Links to audio files were added for music at the end of each
monthly episode. The music files are the music transcriber's
interpretation of the printed notation and are placed in the public
domain. At the time of this writing, music file links will not work in
mobile e-book formats like epub or Kindle/mobi. Users who are reading
the e-book in one of these formats can listen to the music or download
music files in the HTML version. Lyrics to musical scores are
presented as poetry following the illustration of the music.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
